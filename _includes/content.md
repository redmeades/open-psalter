## About ##

The Open Psalter brings two things together - a four-week cycle of
readings from the Psalms and the epub format.

<!--
## Features ##
  
* 4 weeks of full readings
* Mobile and e-reader friendly epub
-->

The idea was taken from [The Paraclete Psalter](https://www.amazon.com/Paraclete-Psalter-Four-Week-Cycle-Prayer/dp/1557256632) published by [Paraclete Press](http://www.paracletepress.com) -- I simply
wanted an epub format of it in order to use it on an ebook reader when
travelling[^fn1]. I have used their arragement of readings in order to be
consistent but I needed to change the translation used for copyright reasons,
and so I decided on the openly available [The Open English Bible](http://openenglishbible.org).

[^fn1]: I have since discovered that Paraclete Press are no longer publishing
    the book and have released an [epub version](http://www.paracletepress.com/Products/3888/the-paraclete-psalter-epub-edition.aspx)
    of the book.
