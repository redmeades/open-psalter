##### Psalm 75 — God the Judge #####

For the leader; al tashheth. A psalm of Asaph, a song.

|   [75:1] We praise you, God, we praise you:
|    we would call on your name and declare your wonders.

|   [75:2] ‘At the time I choose,
|    I will judge fairly.
|   [75:3] Though earth melt and all her inhabitants,
|    it is I who keep steady her pillars.’ (Selah)
|   [75:4] I say to the boasters, ‘Boast not ‘;
|    to the wicked, ‘Lift not up your horn:
|   [75:5] lift not your horn on high,
|    speak not boldly against the Rock.’

|   [75:6] For not from east nor west,
|    not from desert nor mountains;
|   [75:7] but God himself is the judge,
|    humbling one and exalting another.

|   [75:8] In the hand of the LORD is a cup
|    foaming wine, richly spiced.
|  Out of this he pours a draught,
|    and all the wicked of earth
|    must drain it down to the dregs.

|   [75:9] But I will rejoice forever,
|    singing praise to the God of Jacob.
|   [75:10] I will hew all the horns of the wicked,
|    but the horns of the just shall be lifted.

##### Psalm 94 — A Prayer for Vengeance on the Cruel #####

|   [94:1] LORD, God of vengeance,
|    God of vengeance, shine forth.
|   [94:2] Rise up, judge of the earth,
|    pay back the proud what they deserve.

|   [94:3] LORD, how long shall the wicked,
|    how long shall the wicked exult,
|   [94:4] with their blustering arrogant words,
|    their braggart and wicked speech,
|   [94:5] crushing your people, LORD,
|    and afflicting your heritage,
|   [94:6] murdering widows and strangers,
|    slaying the fatherless?
|   [94:7] They think that the LORD does not see,
|    nor the God of Jacob regard it.

|   [94:8] Take heed, you dullest of people;
|    when will you be wise, you fools?
|   [94:9] Is he deaf, who shaped the ear?
|    Is he blind, who fashioned the eye?
|   [94:10] Can he who trains nations not punish them
|    he who teaches knowledge to people?
|   [94:11] The LORD knows the thoughts of people,
|    that only a breath are they.

|   [94:12] Happy are those whom you chasten,
|    and teach out of your law,
|   [94:13] keeping them calm in the day of misfortune,
|    till a pit be dug for the wicked.

|   [94:14] For the LORD will not leave his people,
|    he will not forsake his inheritance.
|   [94:15] For the righteous shall come to their rights,
|    and all true-hearted people shall follow them.

|   [94:16] Who will rise up for me against those who do evil?
|    Who will stand up for me against workers of wrong?
|   [94:17] Were it not for the help of the LORD,
|    I would soon have gone to the silent grave.
|   [94:18] When I thought that my foot was slipping,
|    your kindness, LORD, held me up.
|   [94:19] When with cares my heart was crowded,
|    your comforts make me glad.

|   [94:20] Can corrupt justice be your ally,
|    framing mischief by statute?
|   [94:21] They assail the life of the righteous,
|    and innocent blood condemn.
|   [94:22] But the LORD is my sure retreat,
|    my God is the rock of my refuge.
|   [94:23] He will bring back their sin upon them,
|    for their wickedness he will destroy them;
|    the LORD our God will destroy them.
