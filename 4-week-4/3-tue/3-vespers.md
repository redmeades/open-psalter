##Tuesday Vespers

##### Psalm 114 — The Marvel of the Exodus #####

|   [114:1] When Israel went out of Egypt,
|    Jacob’s house from a barbarous people,
|   [114:2] God chose Judah for himself,
|    Israel became his kingdom.

|   [114:3] The sea saw it, and fled,
|    Jordan river ran backwards.
|   [114:4] Mountains skipped like rams,
|    hills like the young of the flock.

|   [114:5] Why, sea, do you flee?
|    Jordan, why run backwards?
|   [114:6] Mountains, why skip ram-like?
|    Why, hills, like the young of the flock?

|   [114:7] Earth, tremble before the LORD,
|    at the presence of Jacob’s God,
|   [114:8] who turns rocks into pools of water,
|    and flint into fountains of water.

##### Psalm 115 — Israel’s Incomparable God #####

|   [115:1] Not to us, LORD, not to us,
|    but to your name give glory,
|    for your kindness” and faithfulness” sake.
|   [115:2] Why should the heathen say,
|    ‘Where is now their God?’
|   [115:3] Our God he is in heaven;
|    whatever he wishes, he does.
|   [115:4] Their idols are silver and gold,
|    made by human hands.
|   [115:5] They have mouths, but cannot speak;
|    they have eyes, but cannot see.
|   [115:6] They have ears, but cannot hear;
|    they have noses, but cannot smell.
|   [115:7] They have hands, but cannot feel;
|    they have feet, but cannot walk:
|    no sound comes from their throats.
|   [115:8] Their makers become like them,
|    so do all who trust in them.

|   [115:9] O Israel, trust in the LORD :
|    he is their help and their shield.
|   [115:10] House of Aaron, trust in the LORD :
|    he is their help and their shield.
|   [115:11] You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD
|     he is their help and their shield.

|   [115:12] The LORD, mindful of us, will bless us:
|    he will bless the house of Israel,
|    he will bless the house of Aaron.
|   [115:13] He will bless those who fear the LORD,
|    the small and the great together.

|   [115:14] May the LORD add to your numbers
|    to you and to your children.
|   [115:15] Blessed be you of the LORD,
|    creator of heaven and earth.

|   [115:16] The heavens are the heavens of the LORD,
|    but the earth has he given to people.
|   [115:17] The dead cannot praise the LORD,
|    nor those who go down into silence.
|   [115:18] But we will bless the LORD
|     from now and for evermore.
|      Hallelujah.

##### Psalm 116 — Song of Thanksgiving for Deliverance #####

|   [116:1] I love the LORD, for he hears
|    my voice, my pleas for mercy.
|   [116:2] For he has inclined his ear to me:
|    I will call upon him as long as I live.

|   [116:3] About me were snares of death,
|    the anguish of Sheol was upon me:
|    distress and sorrow were mine.
|   [116:4] Then I called on the name of the LORD :
|    ‘I beseech you, O LORD, deliver me.’

|   [116:5] Gracious and just is the LORD,
|    compassionate is our God.
|   [116:6] The LORD preserves the simple;
|    when I was drooping, he saved me.
|   [116:7] Be at peace, my heart, once more,
|    for the LORD has been good to you.

|   [116:8] You have rescued me from death,
|    my eyes from tears,
|    my feet from stumbling.
|   [116:9] Before the LORD I will walk
|    in the land of the living.

|   [116:10] I held fast my faith, though I said,
|    ‘Ah me! I am sore afflicted‘,
|   [116:11] though in my alarm I said,
|    ‘Everyone is a liar.’

|   [116:12] What shall I render the LORD
|     for all his bounty to me?
|   [116:13] I will lift up the cup of salvation,
|    and call on the name of the LORD .
|   [116:14] I will pay my vows to the LORD
|     in the presence of all his people.

|   [116:15] Grave in the eyes of the LORD
|     is the death of his loyal and loved ones.
|   [116:16] Ah, LORD ! I am your servant,
|    your servant, child of your handmaid.
|    You have loosened my bonds.

|   [116:17] I will offer to you a thank-offering,
|    and call on the name of the LORD .
|   [116:18] I will pay my vows to the LORD
|     in the presence of all his people,
|   [116:19] in the courts of the house of the LORD,
|    in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.
|      Hallelujah.

##### Psalm 117 — A Call to Praise #####

|   [117:1] Praise the LORD, all you nations:
|    laud him, all you peoples.
|   [117:2] For his mighty love is over us:
|    the LORD is faithful forever.
|      Hallelujah.
