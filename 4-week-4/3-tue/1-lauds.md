##### Psalm 29 — The Lord’s Glory in the Storm #####

A psalm of David.

|   [29:1] Ascribe to the LORD, you heavenly beings,
|    ascribe to the LORD glory and power
|   [29:2] Ascribe to the LORD the glory he manifests:
|    bow to the LORD in holy array.

|   [29:3] The LORD’s voice peals on the waters.
|    The God of glory has thundered.
|    He peals o”er the mighty waters.
|   [29:4] The LORD’s voice sounds with strength,
|    the LORD’s voice sounds with majesty.

|   [29:5] The LORD’s voice breaks the cedars,
|    he breaks the cedars of Lebanon,
|   [29:6] making Lebanon dance like a calf,
|    Sirion like a young wild ox.

|   [29:7] The LORD’s voice hews out flames of fire.
|   [29:8] The LORD’s voice rends the desert,
|    he rends the desert of Kadesh.

|   [29:9] The LORD’s voice whirls the oaks,
|    and strips the forests bare;
|    and all in his temple say ‘Glory.’

|   [29:10] The LORD was king at the flood,
|    the LORD sits throned forever.
|   [29:11] The LORD gives strength to his people,
|    he blesses his people with peace.

##### Psalm 93 — The Lord, King of all the World #####

|   [93:1] The LORD has taken his seat on the throne,
|    clothed with majesty, armed with might.
|  Now the world stands firm, to be shaken no more,
|     [93:2] firm stands your throne from all eternity.
|      You are from everlasting.

|   [93:3] The floods, O LORD, have lifted,
|    the floods have lifted their voice,
|    the floods lift up their roar.
|   [93:4] But more grand than the great roaring waters,
|    more grand than the ocean waves,
|    grand on the height stands the LORD .

|   [93:5] What you have ordained is most sure;
|    most sure shall your house stand inviolate,
|    O LORD, for ever and ever.

##### Psalm 96 — The Lord’s Rule #####

|   [96:1] Sing to the LORD a new song,
|    sing to the LORD, all the earth.
|   [96:2] Sing to the LORD, bless his name,
|    from day to day herald his victory.
|   [96:3] Tell his glory among the nations,
|    his wonders among all peoples.

|   [96:4] For great is the LORD and worthy all praise;
|    held in awe, above all gods:
|   [96:5] for all the gods of the nations are idols,
|    but the LORD created the heavens.
|   [96:6] Before him are splendour and majesty,
|    beauty and strength in his holy place.

|   [96:7] Ascribe to the LORD, you tribes of the nations,
|    ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
|   [96:8] Ascribe to the LORD the glory he manifests:
|    bring you an offering, enter his courts.
|   [96:9] Bow to the LORD in holy array:
|    tremble before him, all the earth.

|   [96:10] Say to the nations, ‘The LORD is king.’
|    The world stands firm to be shaken no more.
|    He will judge the peoples with equity.
|   [96:11] Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice,
|    let the sea and its fulness thunder.

|   [96:12] Let the field, and all that is in it, exult;
|    let the trees of the forest ring out their joy
|   [96:13] before the LORD : for he comes,
|    he comes to judge the earth.
|  He will judge the world with justice
|    and the nations with faithfulness.

##### Psalm 97 — The Lord’s Judgment #####

|   [97:1] The LORD is king, let the earth rejoice:
|    let her many isles be glad.
|   [97:2] Clouds and darkness are round about him,
|    justice and right are the base of his throne.
|   [97:3] Fire goes before him,
|    and blazes around his steps,
|   [97:4] his lightnings illumine the world:
|    the earth quakes at the sight.
|   [97:5] Mountains melt like wax
|    before the LORD of all the earth.
|   [97:6] The heavens proclaim his justice,
|    all nations behold his glory.

|   [97:7] Shamed are all image-worshippers,
|    who make a boast of their idols.
|    All the gods bow before him.
|   [97:8] Zion is glad at the tidings,
|    the towns of Judah rejoice
|    because of your judgments, LORD .
|   [97:9] For you are most high over all the earth,
|    greatly exalted above all gods.

|   [97:10] The LORD loves those who hate evil,
|    he guards the lives of the faithful:
|    from the hand of the wicked he saves them.
|   [97:11] Light arises for the righteous,
|    and joy for the upright in heart.
|   [97:12] Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous:
|    give thanks to his holy name.

##### Psalm 147.1-11 — The Lord’s Love and Power Revealed in Nature #####

|       [147:1] Hallelujah.

|  It is good to sing praise to our God,
|    for praise is sweet and seemly.
|   [147:2] The LORD builds up Jerusalem,
|    the outcasts of Israel he gathers.
|   [147:3] He heals the broken in heart,
|    and binds up their wounds.
|   [147:4] He counts the numberless stars,
|    he gives names to them all.
|   [147:5] Great is our LORD, rich in power,
|    and measureless is his wisdom.
|   [147:6] The LORD lifts up the down-trodden,
|    the wicked he brings to the ground.

|   [147:7] Sing songs of thanks to the LORD,
|    and play on the lyre to our God.
|   [147:8] For he covers the sky with clouds,
|    he prepares rain for the earth,
|    makes grass to grow on the mountains.
|   [147:9] He gives the cattle their food
|    the young ravens when they cry.
|   [147:10] His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse,
|    his joy is not in the speed of a runner;
|   [147:11] but the LORD has his pleasure in those who fear him,
|    in those who wait for his kindness.
