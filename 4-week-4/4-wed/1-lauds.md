##Wednesday Lauds

##### Psalm 67 — A Harvest Thanksgiving #####

For the leader. On stringed instruments. A psalm. A song.

|   [67:1] Bless us, O God, with your favour,
|    let the light of your face fall upon us; (Selah)
|   [67:2] that the world may know your way,
|    and all nations your power to save.

|   [67:3] Let the peoples praise you, O God;
|    let the peoples all of them praise you.
|   [67:4] Let the nations ring out their joy;
|    for you govern the peoples with equity,
|    and guide the nations on earth. (Selah)
|   [67:5] Let the peoples praise you, O God,
|    let the peoples, all of them, praise you.

|   [67:6] The earth has yielded her increase
|    by the blessing of God, our God.
|   [67:7] May this blessing of ours win people to him
|    to all the ends of the earth.

##### Psalm 88 — The Prayer of Despair #####

|   [88:1] O LORD my God,
|    I cry for help in the day-time,
|    in the night my cry is before you;
|   [88:2] let my prayer come into your presence,
|    incline your ear to my cry.

|   [88:3] For I am sated with sorrow,
|    my life draws near to Sheol.
|   [88:4] I am counted with those who go down to the pit;
|    without strength am I.

|   [88:5] My home is among the dead,
|    like the slain that lie in the grave,
|  whom you remember no more
|    cut off as they are from your hand.

|   [88:6] In the deepest pit you have put me,
|    in shadows deep and dark.
|   [88:7] Your wrath lies heavy upon me,
|    waves of your anger roll over me. (Selah)

|   [88:8] You have put my friends far from me,
|    you have made them shun me.
|  I am shut in, and cannot escape,
|     [88:9] my eyes are wasted with sorrow.
|  I call on you, LORD, every day,
|    spreading my hands out to you.

|   [88:10] For the dead can you work wonders?
|    Can the shades rise again to praise you? (Selah)
|   [88:11] Can your kindness be told in the grave,
|    your faithfulness in the tomb?
|   [88:12] Can your wonders be known in the darkness,
|    or your help in the land of forgetfulness?

|   [88:13] I cry for help to you,
|    in the morning my prayer comes before you.
|   [88:14] Why, O LORD, do you spurn me,
|    and hide your face from me?
|   [88:15] From my youth I am wretched and dying,
|    I am numbed by the terrors I bear.

|   [88:16] The fires of your wrath have passed over me,
|    your terrors destroy me,
|   [88:17] surging around me forever,
|    hemming me in altogether.
|   [88:18] Those who love me you put far from me;
|    the dark is my only friend.

##### Psalm 92 — The Ways of God #####

A psalm. A song; for the sabbath day.

|   [92:1] It is good to give thanks to the LORD,
|    to sing praise to your name, O Most High,
|   [92:2] to declare your love in the morning,
|    and your faithfulness in the night,
|   [92:3] with voice and a ten-stringed harp,
|    with music that throbs on the lyre.
|   [92:4] For you make me glad by your deeds, LORD,
|    at the work of your hands I will ring out my joy.

|   [92:5] How great are your works, O LORD ;
|    how deep are your thoughts!
|   [92:6] The insensitive cannot know,
|    nor can a fool understand,
|   [92:7] that, though the wicked flourish like grass,
|    and evil-doers all blossom,
|    they will perish forever.

|   [92:8] But you are exalted forever.
|   [92:9] For see! Your enemies, LORD
|     For see! Your enemies perish,
|    all evil-doers are scattered.
|   [92:10] But you lift me to honour,
|    and anoint me afresh with oil.
|   [92:11] My eyes will feast on my foes,
|    and my ears will hear of the doom of the wicked.

|   [92:12] The righteous will sprout like the palm,
|    will grow like a cedar of Lebanon.
|   [92:13] In the house of the LORD are they planted,
|    in the courts of our God they will sprout.
|   [92:14] They will still bear fruit in old age,
|    all sappy and fresh will they be
|   [92:15] So they proclaim the LORD to be just,
|    my rock, in whom is no wrong.

##### Psalm 147.12-20 — The Lord’s Love and Power Revealed in Nature #####

|   [147:12] Praise the LORD, then, O Jerusalem:
|    sing praise to your God, O Zion.
|   [147:13] For he strengthens the bars of your gates,
|    and blesses your children within you.
|   [147:14] He brings peace to your borders,
|    and choicest of wheat in abundance.
|   [147:15] He sends his command to the earth:
|    his word runs very swiftly.
|   [147:16] Snow he gives like wool,
|    frost he scatters like ashes.
|   [147:17] He casts forth his ice like morsels:
|    who can stand before his cold?
|   [147:18] He sends forth his word, and melts them:
|    his wind blows the waters flow.

|   [147:19] He declares his word to Jacob,
|    his statutes and judgments to Israel.
|   [147:20] No other nation did he do this for,
|    they know nothing of his judgments.
|      Hallelujah.
