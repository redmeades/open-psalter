##### Psalm 135 — The Lord’s Power Revealed in Nature and History #####

|       [135:1] Hallelujah.

|  Praise the name of the LORD .
|    Praise the LORD, you his servants,
|   [135:2] who stand in the house of the LORD,
|    in the courts of the house of our God.
|   [135:3] Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good:
|    “Sing praise to his name it is pleasant.
|   [135:4] The LORD for himself chose Jacob,
|    Israel as his own special treasure.

|   [135:5] For I know that the LORD is great,
|    that our LORD is above all gods.
|   [135:6] All that he wills he does
|    in the heavens and on the earth,
|    in the seas and in all the abysses.
|   [135:7] Clouds he brings up from the ends of the earth,
|    lightnings he makes for the rain,
|    wind he brings out of his storehouses.

|   [135:8] The first-born of Egypt he struck,
|    both humans and animals.
|   [135:9] Signs and wonders he sent
|    into your midst, O Egypt,
|    upon Pharaoh and all his servants.
|   [135:10] Many nations he struck,
|    mighty kings he slew
|   [135:11] Sihon, king of the Amorites,
|    Og, king of Bashan,
|    and all the kingdoms of Canaan.
|   [135:12] He gave their land for possession,
|    possession to Israel his people.

|   [135:13] Your name, O LORD, is forever;
|    your memorial world without end.
|   [135:14] For the LORD secures right for his people,
|    and takes pity upon his servants.

|   [135:15] The idols of heathen are silver
|    made by human hands.
|   [135:16] They have mouths, but cannot speak:
|    they have eyes, but cannot see.
|   [135:17] They have ears, but cannot hear:
|    there is no breath in their mouths.
|   [135:18] Their makers become like them,
|    so do all who trust in them.

|   [135:19] House of Israel, praise the LORD :
|    house of Araon, praise the LORD .
|   [135:20] House of Levi, praise the LORD :
|    you who fear the LORD, praise the LORD .
|   [135:21] Blest be the LORD out of Zion,
|    who lives in Jerusalem.
|      Hallelujah.

##### Psalm 138 — The Constancy of the Lord’s Care #####

Of David.

|   [138:1] I will thank you, O LORD, with all my heart:
|    in the sight of the gods I will sing your praise,
|   [138:2] and prostrate before your holy temple,
|    will praise your name for your constant love,
|    for you have exulted your promise above all.

|   [138:3] When I called you, you answered;
|    you gave me strength, you inspired me.
|   [138:4] All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O LORD,
|    when they shall have heard the words you have uttered;
|   [138:5] and they shall sing of the ways of the LORD,
|    and tell of the LORD’s transcendent glory.
|   [138:6] For, high though the LORD is, he looks on the lowly,
|    and strikes down the haughty from far away.

|   [138:7] Though my way be distressful, yet you preserve me:
|    you lay your hand on my angry foes,
|    and your right hand gives me victory.
|   [138:8] The LORD will accomplish all that which concerns me.
|    Your kindness, O LORD, endures forever.
|    O do not abandon the work of your hands.
