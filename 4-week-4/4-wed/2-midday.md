##### Psalm 120 — Prayer for Deliverance from Slander and Treachery #####

A song of ascents.

|   [120:1] In distress I cried to the LORD,
|    and he answered me.
|   [120:2] ‘Deliver me, LORD,
|    from the lip that is false
|    and the tongue that is crafty.’

|   [120:3] What shall he give to you,
|    you tongue that is crafty?
|  What yet shall he give to you?
|   [120:4] Arrows of warrior, sharpened,
|    with glowing broom coals together.

|   [120:5] Woe is me that I sojourn in Meshech,
|    that I live by the tents of Kedar.
|   [120:6] Already too long have I dwelt
|    among those who hate peace.
|   [120:7] I am for peace:
|    but when I speak of it,
|    they are for war.

##### Psalm 121 — The Lord Our Protector #####

##### A song of ascents #####

|   [121:1] I will lift up my eyes to the mountains.
|    O whence shall help for me come?
|   [121:2] From the LORD comes help to me
|    the creator of heaven and earth.

|   [121:3] Your foot he will not let totter:
|    he who guards you will not sleep.
|   [121:4] The guardian of Israel
|    will neither slumber nor sleep.

|   [121:5] The LORD is he who guards you
|    your shelter upon your right hand.
|   [121:6] The sun by day shall not strike you,
|    nor the moon by night.

|   [121:7] From all evil the LORD will guard you,
|    he will guard your life.
|   [121:8] The LORD will guard your going and coming
|    from now and for evermore.

##### Psalm 123 — A Prayer for Mercy #####

A song of ascents.

|   [123:1] I Lift up my eyes to you,
|    who are throned in the heavens.
|   [123:2] As the eyes of a servant
|    turn to the hand of his master,
|  or the eyes of a maid
|    to the hand of her mistress,
|  so do our eyes turn
|    to the LORD our God,
|  until he is gracious to us.

|   [123:3] Be gracious, be gracious to us, LORD .
|    Scorn enough, and more, have we borne
|   [123:4] More than enough have we borne
|    of derision from those at their ease,
|    of scorn from those who are haughty.

##### Psalm 124 — A Magnificent Deliverance #####

A song of ascents. Of David.

|   [124:1] ‘Had it not been the LORD who was for us’
|    let Israel say
|   [124:2] ‘Had it not been the LORD who was for us
|  when enemies rose against us,
|   [124:3] then alive they”d have swallowed us up,
|    when their anger was kindled against us.
|   [124:4] Then the waters would”ve swept us away,
|    and the torrent passed over us clean:
|   [124:5] then most sure would”ve passed over us clean
|    the wild seething waters.’

|   [124:6] Blest be the LORD who has given us not
|    to be torn by their teeth.
|   [124:7] We are like a bird just escaped
|    from the snare of the fowler.

|  The snare is broken,
|    and we are escaped.
|   [124:8] Our help is the name of the LORD,
|    the Creator of heaven and earth.

##### Psalm 125 — A Sure Defence #####

A song of ascents.

|   [125:1] Those who trust in the LORD
|     are like Mount Zion,
|  that cannot be moved,
|    but abides forever.
|   [125:2] Round Jerusalem are the mountains,
|    and the LORD is round his people
|    from now and for evermore.

|   [125:3] For he will not suffer
|    the sceptre of wrong
|  to rest on the land
|    allotted to the righteous;
|  else the righteous might put forth
|    their own hand to evil.

|   [125:4] Do good, O LORD,
|    to the good,
|    and to the true-hearted.

|   [125:5] But those who swerve
|    into crooked ways
|  will the LORD lead away
|    with the workers of evil.

|      Peace be upon Israel.
