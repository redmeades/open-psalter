##### Psalm 139 — The Ever-Present God #####

For the leader. Of David, a psalm.

|   [139:1] O LORD, you search and know me;
|     [139:2] when I sit, when I rise you know it,
|  you perceive my thoughts from afar.

|   [139:3] When I walk, when I lie you sift it,
|    familiar with all my ways.
|   [139:4] There is not a word on my tongue,
|    but see! LORD, you know it all.

|   [139:5] Behind and before you beset me,
|    upon me you lay your hand.
|   [139:6] It’s too wonderful for me to know
|    too lofty I cannot attain it.

|   [139:7] Whither shall I go from your spirit?
|    Or whither shall I flee from your face?
|   [139:8] If I climb up to heaven, you are there:
|    or make Sheol my bed, you are there.

|   [139:9] If I lift up the wings of the morning
|    and fly to the end of the sea,
|   [139:10] there also your hand would grasp me,
|    and your right hand take hold of me.

|   [139:11] If I say, ‘Let the darkness cover me,
|    and night be the light about me,’
|   [139:12] The dark is not dark for you,
|    but night is as light as the day.

|   [139:13] For you did put me together;
|    in my mother’s womb you did weave me.
|   [139:14] I give you praise for my fashioning
|    so full of awe, so wonderful.
|    Your works are wonderful.

|  You knew me right well;
|     [139:15] my bones were not hidden from you,
|  when I was made in secret,
|    and woven in the depths of the earth.

|   [139:16] Your eyes saw all my days:
|    they stood on your book every one
|  written down, before they were fashioned,
|    while none of them yet was mine.

|   [139:17] But how far, O God, beyond measure
|    are your thoughts! How mighty their sum!
|   [139:18] Should I count, they are more than the sand.
|    When I wake, I am still with you.

|   [139:19] Will you slay the wicked, O God?
|    And remove from me the bloodythirsty,
|   [139:20] who maliciously defy you
|    and take your name in vain.

|   [139:21] Do I not hate those who hate you, LORD ?
|    Do I not loathe those who resist you?
|   [139:22] With perfect hatred I hate them,
|    I count them my enemies.

|   [139:23] Search me, O God, know my heart:
|    test me, and know my thoughts,
|   [139:24] and see if guile be in me;
|    and lead me in the way everlasting.

##### Psalm 140 — A Prayer for Preservation #####

|   [140:1] Rescue me, LORD, from evil people;
|    from the violent guard me
|   [140:2] from those who plot evil in their heart,
|    and stir up war continually:
|   [140:3] who make their tongue as sharp as a serpent’s,
|    and under whose lips is the poison of adders. (Selah)

|   [140:4] Preserve me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked,
|    from the violent guard me
|    from those who are plotting to trip up my feet.
|   [140:5] The proud have hidden a trap for me,
|    cords they have spread as a net for my feet:
|    snares they have set at the side of my track. (Selah)

|   [140:6] I have said to the LORD, ‘My God are you;
|    give ear, LORD, to my loud plea.
|   [140:7] O LORD my LORD, my saviour mighty,
|    you did cover my head in the day of battle.
|   [140:8] Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked;
|    and what they have purposed, promote you not.’ (Selah)

|   [140:9] Let them not lift up their heads against me.
|    May the mischief they prate bring themselves to destruction,
|   [140:10] may he rain upon them coals of fire,
|    may he strike them down swiftly, to rise no more,
|   [140:11] no place in the land may there be for the slanderer:
|    may the violent be hunted from sorrow to sorrow.

|   [140:12] I know that the LORD will do right by the weak,
|    and will execute justice for those who are needy.
|   [140:13] Surely the righteous shall praise your name,
|    and they who are upright shall live in your presence.
