##### Psalm 101 — A Model King #####

Of David, a psalm.

|   [101:1] If kindness and justice I sing,
|    making melody to you, LORD .
|   [101:2] I would look to the way that is blameless,
|    and make it my own.

|  Within my own house I would walk
|    with an innocent heart.
|   [101:3] I would never direct my eyes
|    to a thing that is base.

|  The impulse to stray I abhor
|    it shall not cling to me.
|   [101:4] Far from me be perverseness of heart,
|    or kinship with evil.

|   [101:5] Who slanders their neighbour in secret,
|    I bring them to silence:
|  haughty looks and proud hearts
|    I will not abide.

|   [101:6] I will favour the true in the land,
|    they shall live in my court.
|  Those who walk in a way that is blameless
|    will be my attendant.

|   [101:7] No one will live in my house
|    who practises guile.
|  No one that speaks a lie
|    will abide in my presence.

|   [101:8] Morn by morn I will wholly wipe out
|    all the bad in the land,
|  and cut off from the LORD’s own city
|    all workers of evil.

##### Psalm 148 — The Universal Chorus of Praise #####

|   [148:1] Praise the LORD from the heavens,
|    praise him in the heights.
|   [148:2] Praise him, all his angels;
|    praise him, all his hosts.

|   [148:3] Praise him, sun and moon;
|    praise him, all stars of light.
|   [148:4] Praise him, you highest heavens,
|    and you waters above the heavens.

|   [148:5] Let them praise the name of the LORD,
|    for at his command they were made.
|   [148:6] And he fixed them for ever and ever
|    by a law which they dare not transgress.

|   [148:7] Praise the LORD from the earth:
|    you depths, with your monsters, all.
|   [148:8] Fire, hail, snow and ice,
|    and stormy wind doing his word.

|   [148:9] All you mountains and hills,
|    all you fruit trees and cedars,
|   [148:10] all you wild beasts and tame,
|    creeping things, birds on the wing.

|   [148:11] All you kings and nations of earth;
|    all you princes and judges of earth:
|   [148:12] young men and maidens together,
|    old men and children together.

|   [148:13] Let them praise the name of the LORD,
|    for his name alone is exalted.
|  Over heaven and earth is his glory.
|     [148:14] He has lifted his people to honour.
|  Wherefore this chorus of praise from his saints,
|    from Israel, the people who stand in his fellowship.
|      Hallelujah.
