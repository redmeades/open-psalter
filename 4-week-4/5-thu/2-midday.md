##### Psalm 126 — Sowing in Tears #####

A song of ascents.

|   [126:1] When the LORD turned the fortunes of Zion,
|    we were like dreamers.
|   [126:2] Then was our mouth filled with laughter,
|    our tongue with glad shouts;
|  then among the nations they said,
|    ‘The LORD has dealt greatly with them.’
|   [126:3] The LORD had dealt greatly with us,
|    and we were rejoicing.

|   [126:4] Turn our fortunes, O LORD,
|    as the streams in the Negreb.
|   [126:5] They who sow in tears
|    shall reap with glad shouts.
|   [126:6] Forth they fare, with their burden of seed,
|    and they weep as they go.
|  But home, home, with glad shouts they shall come
|    with their arms full of sheaves.

##### Psalm 127 — The Need of Heavenly Help #####

A song of ascents. Of Solomon.

|   [127:1] Unless the LORD builds the house,
|    those who build it labour in vain.
|  Unless the LORD guards the city,
|    the watchman wakes in vain.

|   [127:2] In vain you rise early,
|    and finish so late,
|    and so eat sorrow’s bread;
|  for he cares for his loved ones
|    in their sleep.

|   [127:3] Children are a gift of the LORD,
|    the fruit of the womb, a reward.
|   [127:4] Like arrows wielded by warriors,
|    are the children of youth.

|   [127:5] Happy the man who has filled
|    his quiver full of them.
|  He will not be ashamed when he speaks
|    with enemies in the gate.

##### Psalm 128 — The Blessings of Home #####

A song of ascents.

|   [128:1] Happy all who fear the LORD,
|    who walk in his ways.
|   [128:2] You will eat what your hands have toiled for,
|    and be happy and prosperous!

|   [128:3] Like a fruitful vine shall your wife be
|    in the innermost room of your house:
|  your children, like olive shoots,
|    round about your table.

|   [128:4] See! This is the blessing
|    of the man who fears the LORD .
|   [128:5] The LORD shall bless you from Zion.
|    You will see Jerusalem nourish
|  all the days of your life.
|     [128:6] You will see your children’s children.

|      Peace upon Israel.

##### Psalm 129 — A Prayer for the Discomfiture of the Enemies of Zion #####

A song of ascents.

|   [129:1] ‘Sore have they vexed me from youth’
|    thus let Israel say
|   [129:2] ‘Sore have they vexed me from youth,
|    but they have not prevailed against me.

|   [129:3] The ploughers ploughed on my back,
|    they made their furrows long.
|   [129:4] But the LORD, who is righteous, has cut
|    the cords of the wicked.’

|   [129:5] Let all who are haters of Zion
|    be put to shame and defeated.
|   [129:6] May they be as the grass on the house-top,
|    which withers before it shoots up;

|   [129:7] which fills not the arms of the reaper,
|    nor the lap of the binder of sheaves
|   [129:8] whereof no one says as they pass,
|    ‘The blessing of God be upon you.’

|      In the name of the LORD we bless you.

##### Psalm 130 — Out of the Depths #####

A song of ascents.

|   [130:1] Out of the depths
|    I call to you, LORD .
|   [130:2] LORD, hear my voice:
|    give heed with your ears
|    to my loud plea.

|   [130:3] If you should mark sin, LORD,
|    O LORD, who could stand?
|   [130:4] But with you is forgiveness,
|    that you may be feared.

|   [130:5] I wait for the LORD,
|    I wait for his word,
|   [130:6] I look for the LORD
|     more than watchman for morning,
|    than watchman for morning.

|   [130:7] Israel, hope in the LORD :
|    with the LORD there is love
|  with him plenteous redemption.
|   [130:8] And he redeems Israel
|    from all his iniquities.
