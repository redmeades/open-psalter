##### Psalm 24 — The True Worshipper #####

Of David. A psalm.

|   [24:1] The earth is the LORD’s and all that it holds,
|    the world and those who live in it.
|   [24:2] For he founded it on the seas,
|    and on the floods he sustains it.

|   [24:3] Who may ascend the hill of the LORD ?
|    Who may stand in his holy place?
|   [24:4] The clean of hands, the pure of heart,
|    who sets not their heart upon sinful things,
|    nor swears with intent to deceive:
|   [24:5] they win from the LORD a blessing:
|    God is their champion and saviour.
|   [24:6] Such must be those who resort to him,
|    and seek the face of the God of Jacob. (Selah)

##### The Lords’s Triumphal Entry into the Sanctuary #####

|   [24:7] Lift high your heads, you gates —
|    Higher, you ancient doors;
|    welcome the glorious king.
|   [24:8] ‘Who is the glorious king?’
|    ‘The LORD strong and heroic,
|    the LORD heroic in battle.’

|   [24:9] Lift high your heads, you gates —
|    Higher, you ancient doors;
|    welcome the glorious king.
|   [24:10] ‘Who is the glorious king?’
|    ‘The LORD, the God of hosts,
|    he is the glorious king.’ (Selah)

##### Psalm 82 — God the Upholder of Justice #####

A psalm of Asaph.

|   [82:1] God has taken his stand
|    in the divine assembly:
|    in the midst of the gods he holds judgment.
|   [82:2] ‘How long will you crookedly judge,
|    and favour the wicked? (Selah)
|   [82:3] Do right by the weak and the orphan,
|    acquit the innocent poor.
|   [82:4] Rescue the weak and the needy,
|    save them from the hand of the wicked.

|   [82:5] They have neither knowledge nor insight,
|    in darkness they walk to and fro,
|    while the earth’s foundations totter.
|   [82:6] It was I who appointed you gods,
|    children of the Most High all of you.
|   [82:7] Yet like mortals you will surely die,
|    you will fall like any prince.’

|   [82:8] Arise, O God, judge the earth,
|    for all nations are yours by inheritance.

##### Psalm 84 — The Song of the Pilgrims #####

For the leader. On the gittith. Of the Korahites, a psalm.

|   [84:1] How dearly loved is the place where you live,
|    LORD of hosts!
|   [84:2] How I long and yearn
|    for the courts of the LORD .
|  Now heart and flesh cry for joy
|    to the living God.

|   [84:3] Even the sparrow has found her a home
|    and the swallow a nest,
|  to lay her young,
|    near your altar,
|  LORD of hosts,
|    my king and my God.
|   [84:4] Happy those who live in your house,
|    praising you evermore. (Selah)

|   [84:5] Happy those whose strength is in you,
|    people with pilgrim hearts.
|   [84:6] As they pass through the valley of tears,
|    they make it a place of fountains,
|    clothed with the blessings of early rain.
|   [84:7] From rampart to rampart on they march,
|    till at last God reveals himself in Zion.

|   [84:8] LORD, God of hosts, hear my prayer,
|    give ear, O God of Jacob. (Selah)
|   [84:9] Behold, O God, our defender,
|    and look upon your anointed,
|   [84:10] for better a single day in your courts
|    than a thousand in my own chambers:
|  better stand at the door of the house of my God
|    than live in the tents of ungodliness,
|   [84:11] for the LORD is sun and shield,
|    the LORD gives grace and glory.
|  He withholds no good thing from the life that is blameless.
|   [84:12] LORD of hosts,
|    happy those whose trust is in you.

##### Psalm 90 — Hymn of Eternity #####

A prayer of Moses, the man of God.

|   [90:1] LORD, you have been a home to us
|    one generation after another.
|   [90:2] Before the mountains were born,
|    or the earth and the world were brought forth,
|  from everlasting to everlasting
|    you are God.

|   [90:3] You bring us back to the dust,
|    you summon mortals to return.
|   [90:4] For you see a thousand years
|    as the passing of yesterday,
|    as a watch in the night.

|   [90:5] Your floods sweep them away;
|  they are like a dream,
|    or like grass which sprouts in the morning,
|   [90:6] which blossoms and sprouts in the morning,
|    but by evening is cut and withered.

|   [90:7] For your anger consumes us,
|    the heat of your wrath confounds us.
|   [90:8] Our sins you have set before you,
|    our secrets in the light of your face.
|   [90:9] For through your wrath our days are declining,
|    we bring our years to an end as a sigh.

|   [90:10] The span of our life is seventy years,
|    or, if we are strong, maybe eighty;
|  yet is their breadth but empty toil,
|    for swiftly they go, and we fly away.

|   [90:11] Who lays to heart the power of your anger?
|    Or who stands in reverent awe of your wrath?
|   [90:12] O teach us to count our days
|    so our minds may learn wisdom.

|   [90:13] Return, O LORD ; why so long?
|    Relent on your servants.
|   [90:14] Grant us your love to the full in the morning,
|    that all our days we may shout for joy.

|   [90:15] Make us glad for the days you have humbled us,
|    for the evil years we have seen.
|   [90:16] Let your servants see you in action,
|    show your majesty to their children.
|   [90:17] Let the grace of the LORD our God be upon us,
|    uphold what our hands are striving to do.

##### Psalm 146 — The Great Protector #####

|   [146:1] My soul, praise the LORD .
|     [146:2] I will praise the LORD, while I live;
|  I will sing to my God, while I am.

|   [146:3] Put not your trust in princes
|    mortals, in whom is no help.
|   [146:4] When their breath goes out,
|    they go back to the dust:
|  on that very day
|    their purposes perish.
|     [146:5] Happy those whose help
|    is the God of Jacob:
|  whose hope is set
|    on the LORD their God,
|   [146:6] the Creator of heaven and earth,
|    the sea, and all that is in them.

|  He remains eternally loyal.
|     [146:7] For the wronged he executes justice;
|  he gives bread to the hungry;
|    the LORD releases the prisoners.
|   [146:8] The LORD gives sight to the blind:
|    the LORD raises those who are bowed.
|  The LORD loves the righteous.
|     [146:9] The LORD preserves the stranger,
|  upholds the widow and orphan,
|    but the wicked he leads to disaster.

|   [146:10] The LORD shall reign forever,
|    your God, O Zion, to all generations.
|      Hallelujah.
