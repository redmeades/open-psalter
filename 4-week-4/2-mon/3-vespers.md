##### Psalm 107 — The Song of the Redeemed #####

|   [107:1] Give thanks to the LORD for his goodness
|    for his kindness endures forever.
|   [107:2] Let this be the song of the ransomed,
|    whom the LORD has redeemed from distress,
|   [107:3] gathering them from all lands,
|    east, west, north, and south.

|   [107:4] In the wastes of the desert some wandered,
|    finding no way to a city inhabited.
|   [107:5] Full of hunger and thirst,
|    their spirit failed.
|   [107:6] Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
|    and he saved them from their distresses,
|   [107:7] guiding them straight on the way,
|    till they reached an inhabited city.
|   [107:8] Let them thank the LORD for his kindness,
|    for his wonderful deeds for people;
|   [107:9] for the thirsty he satisfies,
|    and the hungry he fills with good things.

|   [107:10] Some sat in darkness and gloom
|    prisoners in irons and misery,
|   [107:11] for rebelling against God’s word,
|    and spurning the Most High’s counsel.
|   [107:12] Their heart was bowed with toil;
|    there was no one to help when they stumbled.
|   [107:13] Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
|    and he saved them from their distresses.
|   [107:14] Out of darkness and gloom he brought them,
|    and burst their chains.
|   [107:15] Let them praise the LORD for his kindness,
|    for his wonderful deeds for people.
|   [107:16] For he shattered the gates of bronze,
|    and broke bars of iron.

|   [107:17] Some were sick from their wicked ways,
|    and suffering because of their sins.
|   [107:18] All manner of food they hated;
|    they had come to the gates of death.
|   [107:19] Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
|    and he saved them from their distresses.
|   [107:20] He sent his word and healed them,
|    and delivered their life from the pit.
|   [107:21] Let them praise the LORD for his kindness,
|    for his wonderful deeds for people.
|   [107:22] Let them offer to him thankofferings,
|    and with joy tell what things he has done.

|   [107:23] Some crossed the sea in ships,
|    doing business in great waters.
|   [107:24] They have seen what the LORD can do,
|    and his wonderful deeds on the deep.
|   [107:25] At his command rose a tempest,
|    which lifted the waves on high.
|   [107:26] Up to heaven they went, down to the depths;
|    their courage failed them.
|   [107:27] They staggered and reeled like drunkards;
|    all their skills useless.
|   [107:28] Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
|    and he saved them from their distresses.
|   [107:29] He stilled the storm to a whisper,
|    and the waves of the sea were hushed.
|   [107:30] They were glad, because it was quiet;
|    they were led to the haven they longed for.
|   [107:31] Let them praise the LORD, for his kindness,
|    for his wonderful deeds for people.
|   [107:32] Where the people assemble, extol him,
|    and praise him in council of elders.

|   [107:33] He turns streams into a wilderness,
|    springs of water into thirsty land,
|   [107:34] fruitful land into a salt waste,
|    because of the sin of the people.
|   [107:35] A desert he makes pools of water,
|    a land of drought into springs of water.
|   [107:36] He settles the hungry therein,
|    they establish a city to live in.
|   [107:37] They sow fields and plant vineyards,
|    which furnish a fruitful yield.
|   [107:38] By his blessing they multiply greatly,
|    and he lets not their cattle decrease.

|   [107:39] Yet when they are bowed and diminished
|    by oppression, misfortune, or sorrow,
|   [107:40] he pours contempt upon princes,
|    and on trackless wastes leads them astray
|   [107:41] He lifts the poor out of misery,
|    and makes families fruitful as flocks.
|   [107:42] At this sight shall the upright be glad,
|    and all wicked mouths shall be stopped.
|   [107:43] Let those who are wise observe this,
|    and consider the love of the LORD

##### Psalm 137 — By the Waters of Babylon #####

|   [137:1] By the waters of Babylon there we sat,
|    and we wept at the thought of Zion.
|   [137:2] There on the poplars we hung our harps.
|     [137:3] For there our captors called for a song:
|  our tormentors, rejoicing, saying:
|    ‘Sing us one of the songs of Zion.’

|   [137:4] How can we sing the LORD’s song
|    in the foreigner’s land?
|   [137:5] If I forget you, Jerusalem,
|    may my right hand wither.
|     [137:6] May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,
|  if I am unmindful of you,
|    or don’t set Jerusalem
|    above my chief joy.

|   [137:7] Remember the Edomites, LORD,
|    the day of Jerusalem’s fall,
|  when they said, ‘Lay her bare, lay her bare,
|    right down to her very foundation.’

|   [137:8] Babylon, despoiler,
|    happy are those who pay you back
|    for all you have done to us.
|   [137:9] Happy are they who seize and dash
|    your children against the rocks.
