##### Psalm 70 — A Cry for Help in Persecution #####

For the leader. Of David. For commemoration.

|   [70:1] Quickly, God, deliver me,
|    hasten to help me, LORD .
|   [70:2] May those who are seeking my life,
|    be ashamed and confounded.
|   [70:3] May those who delight in my hurt
|    be defeated and brought to dishonour.
|   [70:4] But may all who seek after you
|    rejoice and be glad in you.
|  May all who love your salvation
|    say, ‘Glory to God,’ evermore.
|   [70:5] I am weak and needy:
|    make haste, God, to me.
|  You are my help and deliverer;
|    LORD, don’t delay.

##### Psalm 73 — Fellowship with God Here and Hereafter #####

A psalm of Asaph.

|   [73:1] Yes, God is good to the upright,
|    the LORD to the pure in heart.
|   [73:2] But my feet were almost gone,
|    my steps had nearly slipped,
|   [73:3] through envy of godless braggarts,
|    when I saw how well they fared.

|   [73:4] For never a pang have they,
|    their body is sound and sleek.
|   [73:5] They have no trouble like mortals,
|    no share in human pain.
|   [73:6] So they wear their pride like a necklace,
|    they put on the garment of wrong,
|   [73:7] their eyes stand out with fatness,
|    their heart swells with riotous fancies.
|   [73:8] Their speech is mocking and evil,
|    condescending and crooked their speech.
|   [73:9] They have set their mouth in the heavens,
|    while their tongue struts about on the earth.
|   [73:10] Small wonder that people resort to them,
|    and drink deep draughts of their lore.
|   [73:11] ‘How does God know?’ they say,
|    ‘And has the Most High any knowledge?’
|   [73:12] See! These are the godless,
|    with wealth and ease ever increasing.

|   [73:13] Yes, in vain have I kept my heart pure,
|    and washed my hands in innocence;
|   [73:14] for all the day long was I plagued
|    not a morning but I was chastised.
|   [73:15] But to resolve to speak like they do
|    would be treachery to your children.

|   [73:16] So I sought to understand it,
|    but a wearisome task it seemed:
|   [73:17] till I entered the holy world of God
|    and saw clearly their destiny.

|   [73:18] Yes, you set them on slippery places;
|    down to destruction you hurl them.
|   [73:19] One moment and then what a horror of ruin!
|    They are finished and ended in terrors.
|   [73:20] Like a dream, when one wakes, shall they be,
|    whose phantoms the waker despises.

|   [73:21] So my bitterness of mind
|    and the pain that stabbed my heart
|   [73:22] show how dull I was and stupid
|    just like a beast before you.

|   [73:23] But I am always with you,
|    you have hold of my right hand.
|   [73:24] By a plan of yours you guide me
|    and will afterward take me to glory.

|   [73:25] Whom have I in the heavens but you?
|    And on earth there is none I desire beside you.
|   [73:26] Though flesh and heart waste away,
|    yet God is the rock of my heart,
|    yet God is my portion forever.

|   [73:27] For see! Those who are far from you must perish,
|    you destroy all who are false to you.
|   [73:28] But I am happy when close to God;
|    the LORD my God I have made my refuge,
|    that I may recount all the things you have done.
