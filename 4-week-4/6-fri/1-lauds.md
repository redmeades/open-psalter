##### Psalm 122 — The Joy and the Prayer of the Pilgrims #####

A song of ascents. Of David.

|   [122:1] I was glad when they said to me,
|    ‘We will go to the house of the LORD .’
|   [122:2] Now we are standing,
|    within your gates, O Jerusalem.

|   [122:3] O Jerusalem, built close-packed,
|    like a city without breach or gap,
|   [122:4] to you do the tribes come,
|    the tribes of the LORD,
|  as the law has ordained for Israel,
|    there to give thanks to the LORD .
|   [122:5] There once stood thrones of justice
|    even thrones of the household of David.

|   [122:6] Pray that all may be well with Jerusalem,
|    and well with those who love you,
|   [122:7] well within your ramparts,
|    and well within your palaces.

|   [122:8] For the sake of my brethren and friends,
|    I will wish you now prosperity:
|   [122:9] for the sake of the house of the LORD
|     our God, I will seek your good.

##### Psalm 51 — God be Merciful to Me, the Sinner #####

For the leader. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet come to him after he had been with Bathsheba.

|   [51:1] In your kindness, O God, be gracious to me,
|    in your own great pity blot out my transgressions.
|   [51:2] Wash me clean of my guilt,
|    make me pure of my sin.

|   [51:3] For well I know my transgressions,
|    my sin is ever before me.
|   [51:4] Against you, only you, have I sinned,
|    and done that which is wrong in your sight:
|  you therefore are just when you speak,
|    and clear when you utter judgment.
|   [51:5] See! In guilt was I brought to the birth,
|    and in sin did my mother conceive me.
|   [51:6] It’s the innermost truth you desire,
|    give me therefore true wisdom of heart.

|   [51:7] Purge me clean with hyssop,
|    wash me whiter than snow.
|   [51:8] Fill me with joy and gladness,
|    let the bones you have broken rejoice.
|   [51:9] Hide your face from my sins,
|    and blot out my guilt altogether.

|   [51:10] Create me a clean heart, O God,
|    put a new steadfast spirit within me.
|   [51:11] Cast me not forth from your presence,
|    withdraw not your holy spirit.
|   [51:12] Give me back the joy of your help,
|    with a willing spirit sustain me.

|   [51:13] I will teach your ways to transgressors,
|    and sinners shall turn to you.
|   [51:14] Save me from blood, O God,
|    and my tongue shall ring out your faithfulness.
|   [51:15] Open my lips, O LORD,
|    and my mouth shall declare your praise.

|   [51:16] For in sacrifice you have no pleasure,
|    in gifts of burnt-offering no delight.
|   [51:17] The sacrifice pleasing to God
|    is a spirit that is broken;
|  a heart that is crushed, O God,
|    you will not despise.

|   [51:18] Do good in your pleasure to Zion,
|    build the walls of Jerusalem.
|   [51:19] Then will you welcome the due forms of sacrifice,
|    then on your altars shall bullocks be offered.

##### Psalm 143 — A Prayer for Deliverance and Guidance #####

A psalm of David.

|   [143:1] Listen, O LORD, to my prayer;
|    give ear to my plea.
|  In your faithfulness give me answer,
|    and in your righteousness.
|   [143:2] With your servant O enter you not into judgment,
|    for in your sight can no one alive be justified.

|   [143:3] For the enemy persecutes me,
|    crushing my life to the ground,
|  making me live in the darkness,
|    as those who have long been dead.
|   [143:4] My spirit is faint within me,
|    my heart is bewildered within me.

|   [143:5] I remember the days of old,
|    and brood over all you have done,
|  musing on all that your hands have wrought.
|     [143:6] I spread out my hands to you:
|  I thirst for you,
|    like parched earth. (Selah)

|   [143:7] Answer me soon, LORD,
|    because my spirit is spent.
|  Hide not your face from me,
|    else become I like those who go down to the pit.
|   [143:8] Let me learn of your love in the morning,
|    for my trust is in you.
|  Teach me the way I should go:
|    for my heart longs for you.

|   [143:9] Save me, O LORD, from my foes:
|    for to you I have fled for refuge.
|   [143:10] Teach me to do your will,
|    for you yourself are my God.
|  Guide me by your good spirit,
|    O LORD, on a way that is smooth.

|   [143:11] Be true to your name LORD, spare me,
|    bring me out of distress in your faithfulness.
|   [143:12] In your kindness extinguish my enemies,
|    and all those who vex me destroy;
|    for I am your servant.

##### Psalm 149 — Song of Victory #####

|       [149:1] Hallelujah.

|  Sing to the LORD a new song,
|    sound his praise where the faithful are gathered.
|   [149:2] Let Israel rejoice in its maker,
|    sons of Zion exult in their king.
|   [149:3] Let them praise his name in the dance,
|    making music with lyre and with timbrel.
|   [149:4] For the LORD delights in his people,
|    adorning the humble with victory.

|   [149:5] Let the faithful exult and extol him
|    with glad ringing cries all night long.
|   [149:6] High praises of God in their mouth,
|    and a two-edged sword in their hand:
|   [149:7] on the heathen to execute vengeance,
|    and chastisement sore on the nations,
|   [149:8] binding their kings with chains,
|    and their nobles with fetters of iron,
|   [149:9] to execute on them the doom that is written.

|    This is the glory of all his faithful.
|      Hallelujah.
