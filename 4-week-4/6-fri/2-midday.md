##### Psalm 131 — As a Little Child #####

A song of ascents. Of David.

|   [131:1] O LORD, my heart is not haughty,
|    my eyes are not lofty,
|  I walk not among great things,
|    things too wonderful for me.

|   [131:2] Yes, I have soothed and stilled myself,
|    like a young child on his mother’s lap;
|    like a young child am I.

|   [131:3] O Israel, hope in the LORD
|     from now and for evermore.

##### Psalm 132 — The Ancient Promise to David and Zion #####

|   [132:1] Remember, O LORD, David
|    all his sufferings,
|   [132:2] the oath that he swore to the LORD,
|    and his vow to the Strong One of Jacob,
|   [132:3] never to enter his tent,
|    never to lie on his bed,
|   [132:4] never to give his eyes sleep
|    or his eyelids slumber,
|   [132:5] till he had found a place for the LORD,
|    for the Strong One of Jacob to live in.

|   [132:6] We heard of it in Ephrathah,
|    in the fields of Jaar we found it.
|   [132:7] We went to the place where he dwelt,
|    we bowed ourselves low at his footstool.
|   [132:8] ‘Arise, LORD, and enter your resting-place,
|    you and your mighty ark.
|   [132:9] Let your priests wear a garment of righteousness,
|    your faithful shout aloud for joy.
|   [132:10] For the sake of David your servant,
|    do not reject your Anointed.’

|   [132:11] The LORD swore an oath to David
|    an oath that he will not break;
|  ‘I will set on your throne
|    a prince of your line.
|   [132:12] If your sons keep my covenant
|    and the statutes I teach them,
|  then their sons, too, forever,
|    will sit on your throne.’
|   [132:13] For the choice of the LORD is Zion;
|    she is the home of his heart.

|   [132:14] ‘This is forever my resting-place,
|    this is the home of my heart.
|   [132:15] I will royally bless her provision,
|    and give bread to her poor in abundance.
|   [132:16] Her priests I will clothe with salvation;
|    her faithful will shout for joy.
|   [132:17] There will I raise up for David
|    a dynasty of power.
|  I have set my anointed a lamp
|    that shall never go out.
|   [132:18] Robes of shame I will put on his foes,
|    but on his head a glittering crown.’

##### Psalm 133 — Family together #####

A song of ascents. Of David.

|   [133:1] Behold! How good and how pleasant
|    is the dwelling of kindred together!
|   [133:2] Like precious oil on the head
|    that ran down on the beard,
|  the beard of Aaron, running
|    over the collar of his robe:
|   [133:3] like the dew upon Hermon which falls
|    on the mountains of Zion.
|  For there has the LORD ordained blessing —
|    life that is endless.
