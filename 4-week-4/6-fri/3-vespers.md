##### Psalm 142 — A Prayer for Deliverance from Persecutors #####

A maskil of David, while he was in the cave, a prayer.

|   [142:1] Loudly I cry to the LORD :
|    to the LORD plead loudly for mercy,
|   [142:2] I pour my complaint before him,
|    I tell my troubles to him.

|   [142:3] When my spirit is faint within me,
|    my path is known to you.
|  In the way I am wont to walk in,
|    they have hidden a trap for me.

|   [142:4] I look to the right and the left;
|    but not a friend have I.
|  No place of refuge is left me,
|    not a man to care for me.

|   [142:5] So I cry to you, O LORD :
|    I say, ‘My refuge are you,
|    all I have in the land of the living.’

|   [142:6] Attend to my piercing cry,
|    for very weak am I.
|  Save me from those who pursue me,
|    for they are too strong for me.

|   [142:7] Free me from prison,
|    that I may give thanks to your name,
|  for the righteous are patiently waiting
|    till you show your bounty to me.

##### Psalm 144 — The Warrior’s Song #####

Of David.

|   [144:1] Blest be the LORD my rock,
|    who trains my hands for war,
|    my fingers for fighting.
|   [144:2] My rock and my fortress,
|    my tower, my deliverer,
|  my shield, behind whom I take refuge,
|    who lays nations low at my feet.

|   [144:3] LORD, what are mortals
|    that you care for them,
|  humans,
|    that you think of them?
|   [144:4] They are like a breath,
|    their days as a shadow that passes.

|   [144:5] LORD, bow your heavens and come down:
|    touch the hills, so that they smoke.
|   [144:6] Flash forth lightning and scatter them,
|    your arrows send forth and confound them.

|   [144:7] Stretch out your hand from on high;
|    pluck me out of the mighty waters,
|    out of the hands of foreigners,
|   [144:8] who speak with the mouth of falsehood,
|    and lift their right hand to swear lies.

|   [144:9] O God, a new song I would sing you,
|    on a ten-stringed harp make you music.
|   [144:10] For to kings you give the victory,
|    and David your servant you save.
|   [144:11] Snatch me from the cruel sword,
|    rescue me from the hand of foreigners,
|  who speak with the mouth of falsehood,
|    and lift their right hand to swear lies.

##### The Prosperity of the Lord’s People #####

|   [144:12] May our sons in their youth
|    be as plants well tended:
|  our daughters like cornices
|    carved as in palaces.

|   [144:13] May our barns be bursting
|    with produce of all kinds.
|  In the fields may our sheep bear
|    by thousands and ten thousands.

|   [144:14] May our cattle be fat,
|    our walls unbreached,
|  may no cry of distress
|    ring in our streets.

|   [144:15] Happy the people
|    who fares so well:
|  and so fares the people
|    whose God is the LORD .
