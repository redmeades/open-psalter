##### Psalm 95 — For a Festival. A Hymn of Praise and a Solemn Warning #####

|   [95:1] Come! Let us ring out our joy to the LORD,
|    let us merrily shout to our rock of salvation.
|   [95:2] Before his face let us come with thanks,
|    with songs of praise let us shout to him.

|   [95:3] For the LORD is a great God,
|    king above all gods.
|   [95:4] In his hand are the depths of the earth,
|    the heights of the mountains are his.
|   [95:5] The sea is his, for he made it:
|    the dry land was formed by his hands.

|   [95:6] Come! Let us worship and bow
|    on our knees to the LORD our creator.
|   [95:7] For he is our God; and we
|    are the people he tends, the sheep in his care.

|  If only you would heed his voice today:
|   [95:8] ‘Do not harden your hearts as at Meribah,
|    or at Massah, that day in the desert,
|   [95:9] when your ancestors tempted and tried me,
|    though they had seen my deeds.

|   [95:10] For forty years I was filled with loathing
|    for that generation, so I said:
|  “A people with wandering hearts are they,
|    and ignorant of my ways.”
|   [95:11] So I solemnly swore to them in my anger,
|    that never would they enter my place of rest.’

##### Psalm 63 — A thirst for God #####

A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.

|   [63:1] O God, my God, you, you do I seek:
|    my heart thirsts for you,
|  my body faints for you
|    in a parched and waterless land.

|   [63:2] As I in the temple have seen you,
|    beholding your power and your glory,
|   [63:3] for better than life is your kindness:
|    my lips shall utter your praise.

|   [63:4] So, while I live, I will bless you,
|    and lift up my hands in your name.
|   [63:5] As with marrow and fat am I feasted;
|    with joyful lips I will praise you.

|   [63:6] I call you to mind on my bed,
|    and muse on you in the night watches;
|   [63:7] for you have been my help,
|    I joyfully sing in the shadow of your wings.
|   [63:8] I cling close after you,
|    your right hand holds me up.

|   [63:9] But those who seek after my life
|    shall go down to the depths of the earth,
|   [63:10] given o”er to the power of the sword,
|    or as prey for jackals to devour.

|   [63:11] But the king shall rejoice in God:
|    all who own his allegiance will glory.
|    For the mouth of the false shall be stopped.

##### Psalm 118 — Thanksgiving for Victory #####

|   [118:1] Give thanks to the LORD for his goodness,
|    his kindness endures forever.
|   [118:2] Let the house of Israel now say:
|    his kindness endures forever.
|   [118:3] Let the house of Aaron now say:
|    his kindness endures forever.
|   [118:4] Let those who fear the LORD now say:
|    his kindness endures forever.

|   [118:5] Out of straits I called on the LORD,
|    the LORD answered and gave me room.
|   [118:6] The LORD is mine; I am fearless.
|    What can mere people do to me?
|   [118:7] The LORD is mine, as my help:
|    I shall feast my eyes on my foes.
|   [118:8] It is better to hide in the LORD
|     than to trust in mortals.
|   [118:9] It is better to hide in the LORD
|     than to put any trust in princes.
|   [118:10] Everywhere heathen swarmed round me;
|    in the name of the LORD I cut them down.
|   [118:11] They swarmed, swarmed around me;
|    in the name of the LORD I cut them down,
|   [118:12] they swarmed around me like bees,
|    they blazed like a fire of thorns:
|    in the name of the LORD I cut them down.

|   [118:13] Sore they pushed me, to make me fall;
|    but the LORD gave me his help.
|   [118:14] The LORD is my strength and my song,
|    and he is become my salvation.
|   [118:15] Hark! In the tents of the righteous
|    glad cries of victory are ringing.
|  The hand of the LORD has wrought bravely,
|     [118:16] the hand of the LORD is exalted,
|    the hand of the LORD has wrought bravely.

|   [118:17] I shall not die: nay, I shall live,
|    to declare the works of the LORD .
|   [118:18] Though the LORD has chastened me sore,
|    he has not given me over to death.

|  (The Procession arrives at the Temple)

|   [118:19] ‘Open to me the gates of victory.
|  I would enter therein and give thanks to the LORD .’

|  (The Welcome)

|   [118:20] ‘This is the gate of the LORD :
|  the righteous may enter therein;’

|   [118:21] I thank you because you have heard me,
|    and are become my salvation.

|   [118:22] The stone which the builders despised
|    is become the head-stone of the corner.
|   [118:23] This has been wrought by the LORD ;
|    it is marvellous in our eyes.

|   [118:24] This day is the LORD’s own creation:
|    in it let us joy and be glad.
|   [118:25] O LORD, save us, we pray,
|    O LORD, prosper, we pray.

|   [118:26] Blessed the one who enters
|    in the name of the LORD .
|  From the house of the LORD we bless you.
|   [118:27] The LORD is God,
|    he has given us light.
|  Wreathe the dance with boughs,
|    till they touch the horns of the altar.
|   [118:28] You are my God, I will thank you;
|    O my God, I will exalt you.
|   [118:29] Give thanks to the LORD for his goodness:
|    his kindness endures forever.
