##### Psalm 16 — The Joy of Fellowship with God #####

A michtam of David.

|   [16:1] Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
|     [16:2] I said to the LORD, ‘You are my LORD,
|  my happiness rests in you alone.
|   [16:3] Those who are holy in the land,
|    they, they alone, are the noble ones;
|    all my delight is in them.’

|   [16:4] Those who choose other gods
|    find endless sorrow.
|  In their offerings of blood I will have no part
|    nor take their name on my lips.
|   [16:5] The LORD is my share and my portion,
|    my fate is in your strong hands.

|   [16:6] The boundary lines of my life
|    mark out delightful country,
|    my heritage pleases me well.
|   [16:7] I praise the LORD for his counsel,
|    which so stirs my heart in the night.
|   [16:8] I keep the LORD always in mind:
|    with him at my hand, I can never be moved.

|   [16:9] So my heart is glad, there is joy inside me;
|    and in safety of body I live.
|   [16:10] For you will not give me up to Sheol
|    nor let any who love you see the pit.
|   [16:11] You will show me the path that leads to life,
|    to that fulness of joy which is in your presence,
|    and the pleasures dispensed by your hand evermore.

##### Psalm 17 — A Prayer for Deliverance #####

A prayer of David.

|   [17:1] Listen, O LORD, to my innocence;
|    attend to my piercing cry.
|  Give heed to my prayer
|    out of lips unfeigned.
|   [17:2] Let my vindication come from you,
|    your eyes see the truth.

|   [17:3] When you test my heart when you visit at night,
|    and assay me like silver — you can find no evil.
|  I am determined that my mouth should not lie.
|     [17:4] I gave earnest heed to the words of your lips.
|   [17:5] My steps have held fast to the paths of your precepts
|    and in your tracks have my feet never stumbled.

|   [17:6] So I call you, O God, with assurance of answer;
|    bend down your ear to me, hear what I say.
|   [17:7] Show your marvellous love, you who save from enemies
|    those who take refuge at your right hand.

|   [17:8] Keep me as the apple of the eye,
|    hide me in the shelter of your wings.
|   [17:9] From wicked people who do me violence,
|    from deadly foes who crowd around me.

|   [17:10] They have closed their hearts to pity,
|    the words of their mouths are haughty.
|   [17:11] Now they dog us at every step,
|    keenly watching, to hurl us to the ground,
|   [17:12] like a lion, longing to tear,
|    like a young lion, lurking in secret.

|   [17:13] Arise, LORD, face them and fell them.
|    By your sword set me free from the wicked,
|   [17:14] by your hand, O LORD, from those —
|    whose portion of life is but of this world.
|  But let your treasured ones have food in plenty
|  may their children be full and their children satisfied.

|     [17:15] In my innocence I will see your face,
|  awake I am filled with a vision of you.

##### Psalm 20 — A Prayer for Victory #####

For the leader. A psalm of David.

|   [20:1] The LORD answer you in the day of distress,
|    the name of the Jacob’s God protect you,
|   [20:2] sending you help from the temple,
|    out of Zion supporting you.

|   [20:3] All your meal-offerings may he remember,
|    your burnt-offerings look on with favour. (Selah)
|   [20:4] May he grant you your heart’s desire,
|    and bring all your plans to pass.
|   [20:5] We will shout then for joy at your victory,
|    and rejoice in the name of our God.
|    May the LORD grant your every request.

|   [20:6] Now I am sure that the LORD
|     will help his anointed.
|  From his temple in heaven he will answer
|    by his mighty triumphant right hand.
|   [20:7] Some in chariots are strong, some in horses;
|    but our strength is the LORD our God.
|   [20:8] They will totter and fall,
|    while we rise and stand firm.

|   [20:9] Give victory, LORD, to the king,
|    and answer us when we call.
