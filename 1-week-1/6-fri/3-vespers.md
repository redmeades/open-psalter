##### Psalm 48 — The Marvellous Deliverance of Zion #####

A song. A psalm of the Korahites.

|   [48:1] Great is the LORD and worthy all praise
|    in the city of our God.
|  His holy mountain, [48:2] that rises so fair,
|    is the joy of all the world.
|  Like the mount of the gods is Mount Zion,
|    the city of the great king.

|   [48:3] Once God made himself known
|    as the defence of her palaces.
|   [48:4] For see! A concert of kings
|    passed over the frontier together.
|   [48:5] But one glance, and they were astounded;
|    they hastened away in dismay.
|   [48:6] Trembling took hold of them there,
|    like the pains of a woman in labour.
|   [48:7] They were shattered, as east wind shatters
|    the giant ships in pieces.
|   [48:8] What we heard, we now have seen
|    in the city of the LORD of hosts,
|  the city of our God.
|    God will uphold her forever. (Selah)

|   [48:9] We think, O God, of your love,
|    in the midst of your temple.
|   [48:10] Your fame, O God, like your name, shall extend
|    to the ends of the earth.
|  Victory fills your hand.
|     [48:11] Let mount Zion be glad;
|  let the daughters of Judah rejoice
|    because of your judgments.
|   [48:12] Walk about Zion, go round her;
|    count her towers.
|   [48:13] Set your mind on her ramparts,
|    consider her palaces;
|  that you tell to the next generation
|     [48:14] That such is God,
|  our God he it is who shall guide us
|    for ever and ever.

##### Psalm 49 — The Problem of the Prosperity of the Wicked #####

For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm.

|   [49:1] Hear this, you peoples all;
|    give ear, all you who live in the world
|   [49:2] people of low degree and high,
|    the rich and the poor together.
|   [49:3] My mouth shall utter wisdom,
|    the thoughts of a seeing heart.
|   [49:4] I incline my ear to a proverb,
|    on the lyre I will open my riddle.

|   [49:5] Why should I be afraid in the days of misfortune,
|    when circled by wicked and cunning foes,
|   [49:6] who put their trust in their wealth,
|    and boast of their boundless riches?

|   [49:7] For assuredly no one can ransom themselves,
|    or give to God the price of their life,
|   [49:8] for the ransom of a life is costly,
|    no payment is ever enough,
|   [49:9] to keep them alive for ever and ever,
|    so as never to see the pit at all.

|   [49:10] But see it they will. Even wise people die,
|    the fool and the brutish perish alike,
|    and abandon their wealth to others.
|   [49:11] The grave is their everlasting home,
|    the place they shall live in for ever and ever,
|    though after their own names they called whole lands.
|   [49:12] Despite their wealth,
|    they perish like dumb animals.

|   [49:13] This is the fate of the confident fool,
|    and the end of those who are pleased with their portion. (Selah)
|   [49:14] Like sheep they descend to Sheol
|    with Death for their shepherd;
|  down they go straight to the grave,
|    and their form wastes away in their home below.

|   [49:15] But God will assuredly ransom my life
|    from the hand of Sheol;
|    for he will receive me. (Selah)
|   [49:16] So be not afraid when someone grows rich,
|    when the wealth of their house increases.
|   [49:17] Not a shred of it all can they take when they die,
|    wealth cannot follow them down.
|   [49:18] Though they count themselves happy, when they are alive,
|    and win praise from many for faring so well,
|   [49:19] they must join their ancestors,
|    who see the light nevermore.
|   [49:20] The wealthy are without understanding,
|    they perish like dumb animals.

##### Psalm 59 — A Prayer for Safety #####

For the leader. Al tashheth. Of David. A michtam, when Saul sent men to watch his house in order to kill him.

|   [59:1] Save me, O God, from my enemies;
|    secure me from my assailants.
|   [59:2] Save me from those who do wrong,
|    save me from the bloodthirsty.
|   [59:3] For see! They lay ambush for me,
|    strong men are banded against me
|  not for sin or transgression of mine,
|    for no guilt of mine, O LORD,
|   [59:4] they run and make ready. Awake!
|    Come forth to meet me, and see!
|   [59:5] You, O LORD of hosts,
|    God of Israel, awake!
|  And punish the proud, every one;
|    spare none of the traitors vile. (Selah)

|       [59:6] At evening they come,
|      and, howling like dogs,
|      make their round in the city.
|   [59:7] Look at their venomous mouths,
|    tongues like swords,
|  they think no one
|    hears them.
|   [59:8] But you, LORD, laugh at them,
|    you mock all the insolent.
|   [59:9] My strength, I will sing to you,
|    for God is my sure retreat.
|   [59:10] My God with his love will meet me,
|    and feast my eyes on my foes.

|   [59:11] Slay them not, lest my people forget,
|    let your hosts keep them roaming and wandering.
|   [59:12] In their sinful speech snare them, O LORD ;
|    and may they be trapped in their pride,
|  for the curses and lies that they utter.
|     [59:13] In your wrath make a clean end of them,
|  that people, to the ends of the earth,
|    may know that God rules in Jacob. (Selah)

|       [59:14] At evening they come,
|      and, howling like dogs,
|      make their round in the city.
|   [59:15] They roam about for a feast,
|    and snarl, if they get not their fill.
|   [59:16] But I will sing of your might;
|    I will ring out your love in the morning.
|  For to me you have been a sure refuge,
|    a retreat in the day of my trouble.
|   [59:17] My strength, I will sing praise to you,
|    for God is my sure retreat,
|    my faithful God.
