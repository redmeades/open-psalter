##### Psalm 9 — A Song of Praise the Lord’s Justice #####

For the leader; “almuth labben. A psalm of David.

|   [9:1] With all my heart I will praise the LORD,
|    all your wonders I will rehearse.
|   [9:2] I will rejoice and exult in you,
|    singing praise to your name, Most High;
|   [9:3] because backward my foes were turned,
|    they stumbled and perished before you.

|   [9:4] My right and my claim you have upheld,
|    you did sit on the throne as a fair judge,
|   [9:5] rebuking the nations, destroying the wicked,
|    and blotting their name out forever and ever.
|   [9:6] The foe is vanished, ruined forever,
|    their cities destroyed, their memory perished.

|   [9:7] See! The LORD is seated forever
|    on the throne he established for judgment,
|   [9:8] ruling the world with justice,
|    and judging the nations with equity.

|   [9:9] So the LORD proves a haven to the oppressed,
|    a haven in times of trouble.
|   [9:10] Well may they trust you who know your name,
|    for those who seek you, you never abandon.

|   [9:11] Sing praise to the LORD, whose home is in Zion,
|    declare his deeds among the nations.
|   [9:12] As avenger of blood, he keeps them in mind,
|    he does not forget the cry of the wretched.

|   [9:13] Show me favour, LORD,
|    see how my foes afflict me,
|    lift me up from the gates of death;
|   [9:14] so I may, in your help exulting,
|    tell forth your praise at the gates of Zion.

|   [9:15] The nations are sunk in the pit which they made,
|    in the net that they hid, their own foot is entangled.
|   [9:16] The LORD is revealed in the judgment he wrought,
|    the wicked are snared in their own handiwork. (Selah)

|   [9:17] Let the wicked depart to Sheol,
|    all the nations that live forgetful of God.
|   [9:18] For the needy will not be always forgotten,
|    nor the hope of the helpless be lost forever.

|   [9:19] Arise, LORD ; don’t let them triumph:
|    before your face let the nations be judged.
|   [9:20] Strike them with fear, LORD :
|    show the nations how frail they are. (Selah)

##### Psalm 10 — A Prayer for Help #####

|   [10:1] Why do you stand, LORD, so far away,
|    hiding yourself in times of trouble?
|   [10:2] The wicked, in their pride, are pursuing the helpless:
|    let them be caught in the schemes they have plotted.

|   [10:3] For the wicked boasts of their wanton greed;
|    the robber despises the LORD, and curses him,
|   [10:4] in  wicked pride, thinks:
|    God doesn’t care,
|    God doesn’t call to account.

|   [10:5] Never a season that they do not prosper;
|    your judgments are far above out of their sight:
|    they scoff at their foes.

|   [10:6] Each says in their heart,
|    ‘I will never be shaken;
|  I will live for all time
|    untouched by misfortune.’
|   [10:7] Their mouths are full of deceit and oppression:
|    under their tongues lurks mischief and wrong.

|   [10:8] Lying in secret in some village ambush,
|    and stealthily watching, they murder the innocent.
|   [10:9] Like a lion that lurks in a secret lair
|    they lurk intending to catch the defenceless;
|    to seize them, to drag them away in their net.

|   [10:10] Their victims are crushed,
|    sink down to the ground.
|  Under their claws
|    the hapless fall.
|   [10:11] The wicked say in their hearts
|    that God has forgotten,
|  has hidden his face,
|    will see nothing.

|   [10:12] Arise, LORD, lift up your hand,
|    do not forget the cry of the wretched.
|   [10:13] Why do the wicked treat God with contempt,
|    and say in their hearts, ‘God doesn’t care’?

|   [10:14] You have seen the trouble and sorrow;
|    you mark it all, and will take it in hand.
|  The hapless can count on you,
|    helper of orphans.

|   [10:15] Break the arm of the wicked and evil:
|    search out their sin, till no more be found.
|   [10:16] The LORD is king forever and ever:
|    the nations will vanish from his land.

|   [10:17] LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble,
|    inclining your ear, strengthening their hearts,
|   [10:18] rights you have won for the crushed and the orphan,
|    so no one on earth may strike terror again.
