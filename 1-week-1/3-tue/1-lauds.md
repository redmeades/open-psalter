##### Psalm 29 — The Lord’s Glory in the Storm #####

A psalm of David.

|   [29:1] Ascribe to the LORD, you heavenly beings,
|    ascribe to the LORD glory and power
|   [29:2] Ascribe to the LORD the glory he manifests:
|    bow to the LORD in holy array.

|   [29:3] The LORD’s voice peals on the waters.
|    The God of glory has thundered.
|    He peals o”er the mighty waters.
|   [29:4] The LORD’s voice sounds with strength,
|    the LORD’s voice sounds with majesty.

|   [29:5] The LORD’s voice breaks the cedars,
|    he breaks the cedars of Lebanon,
|   [29:6] making Lebanon dance like a calf,
|    Sirion like a young wild ox.

|   [29:7] The LORD’s voice hews out flames of fire.
|   [29:8] The LORD’s voice rends the desert,
|    he rends the desert of Kadesh.

|   [29:9] The LORD’s voice whirls the oaks,
|    and strips the forests bare;
|    and all in his temple say ‘Glory.’

|   [29:10] The LORD was king at the flood,
|    the LORD sits throned forever.
|   [29:11] The LORD gives strength to his people,
|    he blesses his people with peace.

##### In Praise of the Law #####

|   [19:7] The law of the LORD is perfect,
|    renewing life.
|  The decrees of the LORD are trusty,
|    making the simple wise.

|   [19:8] The behests of the LORD are right,
|    rejoicing the heart.
|  The command of the LORD is pure,
|    giving light to the eyes.

|   [19:9] The fear of the LORD is clean,
|    it endures forever.
|  The LORD’s judgments are true
|    and right altogether.

|   [19:10] More precious are they than gold —
|    than fine gold in plenty,
|  and sweeter they are than honey,
|    that drops from the comb.

|   [19:11] By them is your servant warned;
|    who keeps them has rich reward.
|   [19:12] Who can know their flaws?
|    Absolve me from those I know not.

|   [19:13] Keep your servant from wilful sins —
|    from falling under their sway:
|  then blameless and clear will I be
|    from great offence.

|   [19:14] May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart
|    be pleasing to you, LORD,
|    my rock and redeemer.

##### Psalm 21 — A Prayer after a Victory #####

For the leader. A psalm of David.

|   [21:1] The king rejoices, LORD, in your might,
|    how he exults because of your help!
|   [21:2] You have granted to him his heart’s desire,
|    you have not withheld his lips’ request.  (Selah)

|   [21:3] You came to meet him with rich blessings,
|    you set on his head a golden crown.
|   [21:4] He asked you for life, you gave it —
|    many long days, forever and ever.

|   [21:5] Great is his glory because of your help,
|    honour and majesty you lay upon him.
|   [21:6] For you make him most blessed forever,
|    you make him glad with the joy of your presence.

|   [21:7] For the king puts always his trust in the LORD ;
|    the Most High, in his love, will preserve him unshaken.
|   [21:8] Your hand will reach all your foes,
|    your right hand, all who hate you.
|   [21:9] You will make them like a furnace of fire,
|    when you appear, LORD .
|  The LORD will swallow them up in his wrath.
|    The fire will devour them.
|   [21:10] You will sweep their offspring from the earth,
|    their children from humanity.
|   [21:11] When they scheme against you
|    and hatch evil plots — they will fail.
|   [21:12] For you aim your bow at their faces,
|    make them turn in flight.

|   [21:13] Be exalted, LORD, in your strength,
|  to your might we shall sing and make music.

##### Psalm 147.1-11 — The Lord’s Love and Power Revealed in Nature #####

|       [147:1] Hallelujah.

|  It is good to sing praise to our God,
|    for praise is sweet and seemly.
|   [147:2] The LORD builds up Jerusalem,
|    the outcasts of Israel he gathers.
|   [147:3] He heals the broken in heart,
|    and binds up their wounds.
|   [147:4] He counts the numberless stars,
|    he gives names to them all.
|   [147:5] Great is our LORD, rich in power,
|    and measureless is his wisdom.
|   [147:6] The LORD lifts up the down-trodden,
|    the wicked he brings to the ground.

|   [147:7] Sing songs of thanks to the LORD,
|    and play on the lyre to our God.
|   [147:8] For he covers the sky with clouds,
|    he prepares rain for the earth,
|    makes grass to grow on the mountains.
|   [147:9] He gives the cattle their food
|    the young ravens when they cry.
|   [147:10] His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse,
|    his joy is not in the speed of a runner;
|   [147:11] but the LORD has his pleasure in those who fear him,
|    in those who wait for his kindness.
