##### Psalm 7 — A Prayer to the God of Justice #####

A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD about Cush, the Benjamite.

|   [7:1] LORD my God, I take refuge in you.
|  Deliver me, save me from all who pursue me;
|     [7:2] or like lions they will tear me to pieces,
|    and rend me, past hope of rescue.

|   [7:3] LORD, my God, if my life has been such
|    if my hands have been stained with guilt,
|     [7:4] if friends I paid back with evil,
|    if I plundered my foes without cause,
|   [7:5] may the enemy chase and find me,
|    trample my life to the ground,
|    my honour leave in the dirt! (Selah)

|   [7:6] Arise, LORD, in anger,
|    against my foes rise in fury.
|  Awake for my help:
|    let justice be done.
|   [7:7] Gather the nations about you,
|    and sit on your lofty throne,
|     [7:8] as the LORD, the judge of the peoples.
|  Judge me, LORD, in my innocence
|    and according to my integrity.

|   [7:9] Put an end to the wrong of the wicked,
|    protect the righteous.
|  Searcher of hearts and minds,
|    righteous God.
|   [7:10] God is my shield:
|    he saves the upright in heart.

|   [7:11] God is a just judge,
|    constant in righteous anger.
|   [7:12] He will sharpen his sword without fail,
|    his bow is bent and ready,
|   [7:13] his deadly weapons are ready,
|    his arrows he makes of flame.

|   [7:14] The enemy who conceives evil;
|    pregnant with mischief,
|    giving birth to lies,
|   [7:15] a pit they have made and dug;
|    but into the hole that they made they will fall.
|   [7:16] On their own heads their mischief comes back;
|    on their own skulls their violence comes down.
|   [7:17] I will give thanks to the LORD for his justice,
|    and sing to the name of the LORD Most High.

##### Psalm 28 — An Answered Prayer for Help #####

Of David.

|   [28:1] Unto you, O LORD, do I cry;
|    my rock, be not deaf to me:
|  lest, through holding your peace, I become
|    like those who go down to the pit.
|   [28:2] Hear my loud entreaty,
|    as I cry for help to you,
|  lifting my hands, O LORD,
|    towards your holy chancel.

|   [28:3] Take me not off with the wicked,
|    nor with the workers of wrong,
|  whose speech to their neighbours is friendly,
|    while evil is in their heart.
|   [28:4] Give them as they have done,
|    as their wicked deeds deserve.
|  As their hands have wrought, so give to them:
|    requite to them their deserts.
|   [28:5] They are blind to all that the LORD does,
|    to all that his hands have wrought;
|  and so he will tear them down,
|    to build them up no more.

|   [28:6] Blest be the LORD, who has heard
|    my voice as I plead for mercy.
|   [28:7] The LORD is my strength and my shield;
|    my heart trusts in him.
|  I was helped: so my heart is exultant,
|    and in my song I will praise him.

|   [28:8] The LORD is the strength of his people,
|    the fortress who saves his anointed.
|   [28:9] O save your people,
|    and bless your inheritance.
|  Be their shepherd
|    and carry them forever.

##### Psalm 33 — A Hymn of Thanksgiving #####

|   [33:1] Shout for joy in the LORD, you righteous:
|    praise for the upright is seemly.
|   [33:2] Give thanks to the LORD on the lyre,
|    play to him on a ten-stringed harp.
|   [33:3] Sing to him a new song,
|    play skilfully and shout merrily.
|   [33:4] For the LORD is straight in his promise;
|    and all that he does is in faithfulness.
|   [33:5] Justice and right he loves;
|    the earth is full of his kindness.

|   [33:6] By his word the heavens were made,
|    all their host by the breath of his mouth.
|   [33:7] He gathers the sea in a bottle,
|    the ocean he puts into store-houses.
|   [33:8] Let the whole world honour the LORD,
|    let all who live on earth be in awe.
|   [33:9] For at his word it came into being,
|    at his command it stood forth.

|   [33:10] The LORD frustrates the designs of the nations,
|    what the peoples have purposed, he brings to nought,
|   [33:11] but the LORD’s own design will stand forever,
|    and what his heart has purposed, through all generations.
|   [33:12] Happy the nation whose God is the LORD,
|    the people he chose for himself as his own.

|   [33:13] The LORD looks down from heaven,
|    he sees all of humanity;
|   [33:14] from where he rules he gazes
|    on all who inhabit the earth.
|   [33:15] He fashions the hearts of them all,
|    and gives heed to all that they do.

|   [33:16] It is not by great armies that kings are victorious,
|    it is not by great strength that a warrior saves himself;
|   [33:17] false hope is the war-horse to usher in victory,
|    for all its great might it can provide no escape.

|   [33:18] See! The eye of the LORD is on those who fear him,
|    on those who hope in his kindness;
|   [33:19] to deliver their life from death,
|    and to keep them alive in famine.

|   [33:20] We wait for the LORD :
|    he is our help and our shield.
|   [33:21] For in him our heart is glad,
|    we trust in his holy name.

|   [33:22] Let your kindness, O LORD, be upon us,
|    as is our hope in you.
