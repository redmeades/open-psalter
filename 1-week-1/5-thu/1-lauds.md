##### Psalm 100 — A Call to Worship #####

A psalm of praise.

|   [100:1] Shout, all the earth, to the LORD .
|     [100:2] Serve the LORD with gladness,
|    approach him with ringing cries.
|   [100:3] Be sure that the LORD alone is God.
|    It is he who has made us, and his we are
|    his people, the sheep of his pasture.

|   [100:4] Enter his gates with thanksgiving,
|    his courts with praise.
|  Give thanks to him, bless his name.
|   [100:5] For the LORD is good, his love is forever,
|    and to all ages endures his faithfulness.

##### Psalm 27 — If God is for Me #####

A psalm of David.

|   [27:1] The LORD is my light and my saviour;
|    whom then should I fear?
|  The LORD protects my life;
|    whom then should I dread?

|   [27:2] When the wicked drew near to assail me
|    and eat up my flesh,
|  it was those who distressed and opposed me
|    who stumbled and fell.

|   [27:3] Though against me a host should encamp,
|    yet my heart would be fearless:
|  though battle should rise up against me,
|    still would I be trustful.

|   [27:4] One thing have I asked of the LORD,
|    and that do I long for —
|  To live in the house of the LORD
|     all the days of my life,
|  to gaze on the grace of the LORD
|     and inquire in his temple.

|   [27:5] For he will hide me in his shelter
|    in the day of misfortune.
|  In his sheltering tent he hides me:
|    he lifts me up on a rock.

|   [27:6] And now that my head he has lifted
|  above my encircling foes,
|  I will march round the altar and sacrifice,
|    shouting with joy, in his tent,
|    making music and song to the LORD .

##### The Serenity of Faith #####

|   [27:7] Hear, O LORD, my loud cry,
|    and graciously answer me.
|   [27:8] My heart has said to you,
|    ‘Your face, O LORD, I seek.’

|   [27:9] Hide not your face from me,
|    reject not your servant in anger:
|    for you have been my help.
|  Abandon me not, nor forsake me,
|    O God of my help:
|   [27:10] for father and mother have left me;
|    but the LORD will take me up.

|   [27:11] Teach me your way, O LORD :
|    lead me in an even path,
|    because of my enemies.
|   [27:12] Give me not up, O LORD,
|    unto the rage of my foes;
|  for against me have risen false witnesses,
|    breathing out cruelty.

|   [27:13] Firm is the faith I cherish,
|    that I, in the land of the living,
|    will yet see the goodness of God.
|   [27:14] Let your heart be courageous and strong,
|    and wait on the LORD .

##### Psalm 30 — A Song of Thanksgiving for Deliverance #####

A psalm of David. A song for the dedication of the Temple.

|   [30:1] I will extol you, O LORD,
|    because you have lifted me up,
|  and not suffered my foes to rejoice over me.

|   [30:2] I cried to you for help,
|    O LORD my God, and you healed me.
|   [30:3] You have brought me up, LORD, from Sheol,
|    from my way to the pit back to life you have called me.

|   [30:4] Sing praise to the LORD, faithful people;
|    give thanks to his holy name.
|   [30:5] For his anger lasts only a moment,
|    his favour endures for a lifetime.
|  Weeping may lodge for the night,
|    but the morning brings shouts of joy.

|   [30:6] When all went well, I imagined
|    that never should I be shaken.
|   [30:7] For by your favour, O LORD,
|    you had set me on mountains strong:
|  but you hide your face,
|    and I was confounded.

|   [30:8] Then to you, LORD, I cried,
|    to the LORD I begged for mercy,
|   [30:9] ‘What profit is there in my blood,
|    if I go down to the pit?
|  Can you be praised by dust?
|    Can it tell of your faithfulness?
|   [30:10] Hear, LORD, and show me your favour,
|    LORD be a helper to me.’

|   [30:11] You have turned my mourning to dancing;
|    my sackcloth you have unloosed,
|    and clothed me with joy:
|   [30:12] that unceasingly I should sing your praise,
|    and give thanks to you, LORD my God, forever.

##### Psalm 148 — The Universal Chorus of Praise #####

|   [148:1] Praise the LORD from the heavens,
|    praise him in the heights.
|   [148:2] Praise him, all his angels;
|    praise him, all his hosts.

|   [148:3] Praise him, sun and moon;
|    praise him, all stars of light.
|   [148:4] Praise him, you highest heavens,
|    and you waters above the heavens.

|   [148:5] Let them praise the name of the LORD,
|    for at his command they were made.
|   [148:6] And he fixed them for ever and ever
|    by a law which they dare not transgress.

|   [148:7] Praise the LORD from the earth:
|    you depths, with your monsters, all.
|   [148:8] Fire, hail, snow and ice,
|    and stormy wind doing his word.

|   [148:9] All you mountains and hills,
|    all you fruit trees and cedars,
|   [148:10] all you wild beasts and tame,
|    creeping things, birds on the wing.

|   [148:11] All you kings and nations of earth;
|    all you princes and judges of earth:
|   [148:12] young men and maidens together,
|    old men and children together.

|   [148:13] Let them praise the name of the LORD,
|    for his name alone is exalted.
|  Over heaven and earth is his glory.
|     [148:14] He has lifted his people to honour.
|  Wherefore this chorus of praise from his saints,
|    from Israel, the people who stand in his fellowship.
|      Hallelujah.
