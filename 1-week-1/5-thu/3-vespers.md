##### Psalm 45 — Song for the Marriage of a King #####

For the leader; on shoshannim. Of the Korahites. A maskil. A love song.

|   [45:1] My heart is astir with beautiful words:
|    I will sing a song, concerning the king,
|  with tongue like the pen of a ready writer.

|     [45:2] Your beauty is more than mortal,
|    grace is shed over your lips:
|  therefore God has blessed you forever.
|     [45:3] Warrior, strap your sword on your thigh.
|  What glory and splendour!

|     [45:4] Good fortune attend you, as forth you ride
|  in the cause of good faith, and as champion of justice.
|    May your arm instruct you in deeds of dread.
|   [45:5] Sharp are your arrows; nations fall under you:
|    pierced to the heart are the foes of the king.

|   [45:6] Your throne shall endure for ever and ever
|    your royal sceptre a sceptre of equity.
|   [45:7] Right you love and wrong you hate:
|    therefore the LORD your God anoints you
|    With oil of gladness above your fellows.

|   [45:8] With myrrh, aloes, and cassia your robes are all fragrant,
|    you are gladdened by music of ivory harps.
|   [45:9] King’s daughters stand ready with jewels for you,
|    at your right hand the queen in gold of Ophir.

|   [45:10] Listen, daughter, and see; and incline your ear:
|    forget your folk and your father’s house.
|   [45:11] And when the king desires your beauty,
|    bow to him, for he is your lord.
|   [45:12] So shall the Tyrians come with gifts,
|    and the richest of people will do you homage.

|   [45:13] The king’s daughter is glorious altogether,
|    with dress of pearls inwrought with gold.
|   [45:14] In many-coloured robes she is led to the king,
|    with the virgin companions she brought in her train.
|     [45:15] The king’s palace they enter with joy and rejoicing.

|   [45:16] May sons of yours take the place of your fathers,
|    whom you will make princes in all the land.
|   [45:17] Your name will I celebrate world without end,
|    so that nations shall praise you for ever and ever.

##### Psalm 46 — Our God is a Mighty Fortress #####

For the leader. Of the Korahites, on alamoth. A song.

|   [46:1] God is our refuge and strength,
|    a very present help in trouble.
|   [46:2] So we have no fear, though earth should change,
|    and the hills totter into the heart of the ocean.
|   [46:3] Let its waters roar and foam,
|    let the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.
|  On our side is the LORD of hosts,
|    our sure defence is the God of Jacob. (Selah)

|   [46:4] A river there is, whose streams make glad
|    God’s city, the home the Most High has hallowed.
|   [46:5] God is within her: she cannot be shaken.
|    God helps her at the turn of the morning.
|   [46:6] Nations roared, kingdoms tottered:
|    he uttered his voice, earth melted away.
|   [46:7] On our side is the LORD of hosts,
|    our sure defence is the God of Jacob.

|   [46:8] Come and see what the LORD has done,
|    working appallingly in the earth.
|   [46:9] He stills wars to the ends of the earth-
|    breaking the bow, snapping the spear,
|    burning the chariots in the fire.
|   [46:10] ‘Refrain; and know surely that I am God,
|    high over the nations, high over the world.’
|   [46:11] On our side is the LORD of Hosts,
|    our sure defence is the God of Jacob. (Selah)

##### Psalm 55 — Betrayed by a Friend #####

For the leader. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David.

|   [55:1] Listen, God, to my prayer.
|    Don’t hide yourself from my pleading.
|   [55:2] Hear me, and answer;
|    for bitter is my lament.
|   [55:3] I am wild with the noise of the foe,
|    with the clamour of the ungodly;
|  for they hurl disaster upon me,
|    and attack me with fury.
|   [55:4] My heart shudders within me,
|    terrors of deaths press on me,
|   [55:5] fear and trembling attack me,
|    and horror wraps me round.
|   [55:6] O for the wings of a dove:
|    I would fly away and rest.
|   [55:7] I would wander far away,
|    find refuge in the wilderness. (Selah)
|   [55:8] I would find myself a shelter
|    from raging wind and tempest.

|   [55:9] Confuse them, LORD, upset their plans;
|    for I see violence and strife in the city.
|   [55:10] By day and by night they make their rounds
|    on the city walls,
|  while within is crime and trouble,
|     [55:11] within is ruin.
|  Her market-place is never free
|    of deceit and tyranny.
