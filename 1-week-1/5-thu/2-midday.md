##### Psalm 18.25-50 — A King’s Song of Gratitude #####

|   [18:25] With the loyal you are loyal,
|    and with the blameless blameless.
|   [18:26] With the pure you show yourself pure,
|    but shrewd with the devious.
|   [18:27] For the lowly people you save,
|    but haughty eyes you abase.
|   [18:28] You are my lamp, LORD,
|    my God who enlightens my darkness.
|   [18:29] With you I can storm a rampart,
|    with my God I can leap a wall.
|   [18:30] As for God, his way is perfect;
|    the word of the LORD is pure.
|    He is shield to all who take refuge in him.

|   [18:31] For who is God but the LORD ?
|    And who is a rock but our God?
|   [18:32] The God who arms me with strength,
|    who cleared and smoothed my way.
|   [18:33] He made my feet like hinds” feet,
|    and set me up on the heights.
|   [18:34] He taught my hands how to fight,
|    and my arms how to bend a bronze bow.

|   [18:35] The shield of your help you gave me,
|    your right hand supports me,
|    you stoop down to make me great.
|   [18:36] In your strength I took giant strides,
|    and my feet never slipped.
|   [18:37] So I chased the foe till I caught them,
|    and turned not, till I made an end of them.
|   [18:38] I smashed them, they could not rise,
|    they fell beneath my feet.

|   [18:39] You did arm me with strength for war,
|    you did bow my assailants beneath me.
|   [18:40] You made my foes turn their back to me,
|    and those who did hate me I finished.
|   [18:41] They cried for help, but none saved them;
|    to the LORD, but he answered them not.
|   [18:42] I beat them like dust of the market-place,
|    stamped them like mud of the streets.

|   [18:43] From the strife of the peoples you saved me,
|    you made me head of the nations,
|    peoples I knew not did serve me.
|   [18:44] On the instant they hear, they obey me,
|    foreigners come to me cringing.
|   [18:45] Foreigners lose courage,
|    and come out of their strongholds trembling.

|   [18:46] The LORD is alive! Blest be my rock!
|    Exalted be God, my protector!
|   [18:47] The God who gave me revenge,
|    and brought down nations beneath me,
|   [18:48] who saved me from angry foes,
|    and set me above my assailants,
|    safe from the violent.

|   [18:49] For this I will praise you among the nations,
|    making music, O LORD, to your name:
|   [18:50] for great triumphs he grants to his king,
|    and faithful love he shows his anointed,
|    to David and his seed evermore.

##### Psalm 23 — The Good Shepherd #####

A psalm of David.

|   [23:1] The LORD is my shepherd: I am never in need.
|     [23:2] He lays me down in green pastures.
|  He gently leads me to waters of rest,
|     [23:3] he refreshes my life.
|  He guides me along paths that are straight,
|    true to his name.

|   [23:4] And when my way lies through a valley of gloom,
|    I fear no evil, for you are with me.
|  Your rod and your staff comfort me.

|   [23:5] You spread a table for me
|    in face of my foes;
|  with oil you anoint my head,
|    and my cup runs over.
|   [23:6] Surely goodness and love will pursue me —
|    all the days of my life.
|  In the house of the LORD I will live
|    through the length of the days.
