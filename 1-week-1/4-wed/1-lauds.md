##### Psalm 67 — A Harvest Thanksgiving #####

For the leader. On stringed instruments. A psalm. A song.

|   [67:1] Bless us, O God, with your favour,
|    let the light of your face fall upon us; (Selah)
|   [67:2] that the world may know your way,
|    and all nations your power to save.

|   [67:3] Let the peoples praise you, O God;
|    let the peoples all of them praise you.
|   [67:4] Let the nations ring out their joy;
|    for you govern the peoples with equity,
|    and guide the nations on earth. (Selah)
|   [67:5] Let the peoples praise you, O God,
|    let the peoples, all of them, praise you.

|   [67:6] The earth has yielded her increase
|    by the blessing of God, our God.
|   [67:7] May this blessing of ours win people to him
|    to all the ends of the earth.

##### Psalm 25 — A Prayer for Forgiveness and Protection #####

A psalm of David.

|   [25:1] To you, O LORD, I lift up my heart:
|    all the day I wait for you.
|   [25:2] In you I trust, put me not to shame;
|    let not my foes exult over me.
|   [25:3] None will be shamed who wait for you,
|    but shame will fall upon wanton traitors.
|   [25:4] Make me, O LORD, to know your ways:
|    teach me your paths.
|   [25:5] In your faithfulness guide me and teach me,
|    for you are my God and my saviour.
|   [25:6] Remember your pity, O LORD, and your kindness,
|    for they have been ever of old.
|   [25:7] Do not remember the sins of my youth;
|    remember me in kindness,
|    because of your goodness, LORD .
|   [25:8] Good is the LORD and upright,
|    so he teaches sinners the way.
|   [25:9] The humble he guides in the right,
|    he teaches the humble his way.
|   [25:10] All his ways are loving and loyal
|    to those who observe his charges and covenant.
|   [25:11] Be true to your name LORD,
|    forgive my many sins.
|   [25:12] Who then is the person who fears the LORD ?
|    He will teach them the way to choose.
|   [25:13] They will live in prosperity,
|    their children will inherit the land.
|   [25:14] The LORD gives guidance to those who fear him,
|    and with his covenant he makes them acquainted.
|   [25:15] My eyes are ever toward the LORD,
|    for out of the net he brings my foot.
|   [25:16] Turn to me with your favour,
|    for I am lonely and crushed
|   [25:17] In my heart are strain and storm;
|    bring me out of my distresses.
|   [25:18] Look on my misery and trouble,
|    and pardon all my sins,
|   [25:19] look on my foes oh, so many!
|    And their cruel hatred towards me.
|   [25:20] Deliver me, keep me, and shame not
|    one who takes refuge in you.
|   [25:21] May integrity and innocence preserve me,
|    for I wait for you, O LORD .

|   [25:22] Redeem Israel, O God,
|    from all its distresses.

##### Psalm 26 — Prayer of a Devout Worshipper #####

A psalm of David.

|   [26:1] Defend me, O LORD, for my walk has been blameless;
|    in the LORD have I trusted unswervingly:
|   [26:2] Examine me, LORD, and test me;
|    test my heart and my mind.
|   [26:3] For your love is before my eyes,
|    and your faithfulness governs my way.

|   [26:4] I never sat down with the worthless,
|    nor companied with dissemblers.
|   [26:5] I hate the assembly of knaves,
|    I would never sit down with the wicked;
|   [26:6] but, with hands washed in innocence,
|    I would march round your altar, O LORD,
|   [26:7] singing loud songs of thanks,
|    and telling of all your wonders.
|   [26:8] O LORD, I love your house,
|    the place where your glory lives.

|   [26:9] Do not gather me up with sinners;
|    slay me not with people of blood,
|   [26:10] whose hands are stained with villainy,
|    and whose right hand is filled with bribes.
|   [26:11] But my walk is blameless!
|    O redeem me, be gracious to me.
|   [26:12] My foot stands on even ground,
|    in the choirs I will bless the LORD .

##### Psalm 147.12-20 — The Lord’s Love and Power Revealed in Nature #####

|   [147:12] Praise the LORD, then, O Jerusalem:
|    sing praise to your God, O Zion.
|   [147:13] For he strengthens the bars of your gates,
|    and blesses your children within you.
|   [147:14] He brings peace to your borders,
|    and choicest of wheat in abundance.
|   [147:15] He sends his command to the earth:
|    his word runs very swiftly.
|   [147:16] Snow he gives like wool,
|    frost he scatters like ashes.
|   [147:17] He casts forth his ice like morsels:
|    who can stand before his cold?
|   [147:18] He sends forth his word, and melts them:
|    his wind blows the waters flow.

|   [147:19] He declares his word to Jacob,
|    his statutes and judgments to Israel.
|   [147:20] No other nation did he do this for,
|    they know nothing of his judgments.
|      Hallelujah.
