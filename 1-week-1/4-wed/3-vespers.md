##### Psalm 15 — Standing Firm #####

A psalm of David

|   [15:1] LORD, who can be guest in your tent?
|    Who may live on your holy mountain?

|   [15:2] The person whose walk is blameless,
|    whose conduct is right,
|  whose words are true and sincere;
|     [15:3] on whose tongue there sits no slander,
|  who will not harm a friend,
|     [15:4] nor cruelly insult a neighbour,
|  who regards with contempt those rejected by God;
|    but honours those who obey the LORD,
|  who keeps an oath, whatever the cost,
|     [15:5] whose money is lent without interest,
|  and never takes a bribe to hurt the innocent.

|  The person who does these things will always stand firm.

##### Psalm 38 — A Confession and Prayer for Deliverance #####

A Psalm of David. A lament.

|   [38:1] Reprove me not, LORD, in your anger,
|    and chasten me not in your wrath;
|   [38:2] for your arrows have sunk into me,
|    and your hand lies heavy upon me.

|   [38:3] In my flesh is no soundness
|    because of your anger,
|  no health in my bones,
|    because of my sin.
|   [38:4] For that my guilt
|    is gone over my head:
|  it weighs like a burden
|    too heavy for me.

|   [38:5] My wounds stink and fester,
|    for my foolishness I am tormented.
|   [38:6] Bent and bowed am I utterly,
|    all the day going in mourning.

|   [38:7] My loins are filled with burning,
|    and in my flesh is no soundness.
|   [38:8] I am utterly crushed and numb;
|    I cry louder than lion roars.

|   [38:9] LORD, you know all that I long for,
|    my groans are not hidden from you.
|   [38:10] My heart is throbbing,
|    my strength has failed me.
|  The light of my eyes—
|    even it is gone from me.

|   [38:11] My dear ones and friends keep aloof,
|    and my neighbours stand afar off.
|   [38:12] They who aim at my life lay their snares,
|    they who seek my hurt speak of ruin,
|    nursing treachery all the day long.

|   [38:13] But I turn a deaf ear and hear not;
|    like the dumb I open not my mouth.
|   [38:14] I am like one without hearing,
|    with no arguments in my mouth.

|   [38:15] For my hope, O LORD, is in you.
|    You will answer, O LORD my God,
|   [38:16] when I utter the hope that those
|    who made scorn of my tottering feet
|    may not rejoice over me.

|   [38:17] For I am ready to fall,
|    my pain forsakes me never.
|   [38:18] I acknowledge my guilt,
|    I am anxious because of my sin:

|   [38:19] My wanton assailants are strong,
|    those who wrongfully hate me are many,
|   [38:20] who render me evil for good,
|    and oppose me, because I make good my goal.

|   [38:21] Do not forsake me, O LORD ;
|    my God, be not far from me.
|   [38:22] Hasten to help me,
|    O LORD my saviour.

##### Psalm 44 — A Lament in Defeat #####

For the leader. Of the Korahites. A maskil.

|   [44:1] O God, we have heard with our ears,
|    all our ancestors have told us
|  of the work that you wrought in their day,
|    your wonders in days of old,
|   [44:2] uprooting and crushing the nations,
|    then planting and settling them.
|  For it wasn’t their own sword that won them the land,
|     [44:3] it was not their own arm that brought them the victory.
|  Yours was the hand and the arm,
|    yours was the face that shone on them with favour.
|   [44:4] It was you, my king and my God,
|    that ordained the victories of Jacob.

|   [44:5] Through you we can thrust back our foes,
|    and by your name tread down our assailants:
|   [44:6] for not in my bow do I trust,
|    nor can my sword win me the victory.
|   [44:7] Our victory comes from you,
|    and confusion to those who hate us.
|   [44:8] In God we boast all the day long,
|    and your name will we praise forever. (Selah)

|   [44:9] Yet you have spurned and disgraced us,
|    in not going forth with our armies,
|   [44:10] and in making us flee from the foe,
|    so that those who hated us plundered us.
|   [44:11] You have let us be eaten like sheep,
|    you have scattered us over the world,
|   [44:12] sold your people for a pittance,
|    and getting no gain from their price.
|   [44:13] You have made us the butt of our neighbours,
|    the derision and scorn of all round us.
|   [44:14] O”er the world you have made us a byword,
|    the nations at us shake their heads.
|   [44:15] My disgrace is forever before me,
|    my face is covered with shame,
|   [44:16] at the words of blasphemer and scoffer,
|    at the sight of the foe and the vengeful.

|   [44:17] All this has come upon us,
|    yet we have not forgotten you
|    nor falsely dealt with your covenant.
|   [44:18] Our heart has not turned back,
|    nor our steps declined from your way,
|   [44:19] that you thus should have crushed us down,
|    and covered us over with gloom,
|    in the place where the jackals roam.
|   [44:20] Had we forgotten the name of our God,
|    or stretched out our hands to a god that was strange,
|   [44:21] would God not have searched this out?
|    For he knows the heart and its secrets.
|   [44:22] But in your cause it is we are killed all the day,
|    and counted as sheep for the slaughter.

|   [44:23] Rouse yourself, why do you sleep Lord?
|    Awake, cast us not off forever.
|   [44:24] Why do you hide your face,
|    forgetting our stress and our misery?
|   [44:25] For we have sunk down to the dust,
|    our bodies cling to the ground.
|   [44:26] Arise, come to our help:
|    for your love’s sake, ransom us.
