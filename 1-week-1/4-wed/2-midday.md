##### Psalm 14 — The Folly of Denying God #####

For the leader. Of David

|   [14:1] Fools say in their heart,
|    ‘There is no God.’
|  Vile, hateful their life is;
|    not one does good.

|   [14:2] From heaven the LORD looks out
|    on humans, to see
|  if any are wise,
|    and care for God.

|   [14:3] But all have turned bad,
|    the taint is on all;
|  not one does good,
|    no, not one.

|   [14:4] Have they learned their lesson,
|    those workers of evil?
|  Who ate up my people,
|    eating, devouring,
|    never calling to the LORD .

|   [14:5] Sore afraid will they be;
|    for God is among
|    those who are righteous,
|   [14:6] you may mock the plans of the poor,
|    but the LORD is their refuge.

|   [14:7] If only help from Zion
|    would come for Israel!
|  When the LORD brings his people
|    a change of fortune,
|  how glad will be Jacob,
|    and Israel how joyful!

##### Psalm 18.1-24 — A King’s Song of Gratitude #####

For the leader. Of David, the servant of the LORD, who recited the words of this song to the LORD after the LORD had saved him from the power of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:

|   [18:1] I love you, O LORD, my strength.
|   [18:2] The LORD is my rock, my fortress, deliverer,
|    my God, my rock, where I take refuge,
|    my shield, my defender, my tower.
|   [18:3] Worthy of praise is the LORD whom I call on,
|    he rescues me from all my foes.

|   [18:4] The waves of death broke about me,
|    fearful floods of chaos.
|   [18:5] Sheol threw cords around me,
|    snares of death came to meet me.
|   [18:6] In distress I cried to the LORD,
|    and shouted for help to my God;
|  in his temple he heard my voice,
|    into his ears came my cry.

|   [18:7] Then the earth shook and quaked,
|    mountains trembled to their foundations,
|    and quaked because of his wrath.
|   [18:8] Smoke went up from his nostrils,
|    devouring fire from his mouth,
|    coals were kindled by it.

|   [18:9] Then he bent the sky and came down,
|    thick darkness was under his feet.
|   [18:10] He rode on a cherub and flew,
|    darting on wings of wind,
|   [18:11] with his screen of darkness about him,
|    in thick dark clouds of water.

|   [18:12] At the radiance before him there passed
|    hailstones and coals of fire.
|   [18:13] The LORD thundered from heaven,
|    the Most High uttered his voice.
|   [18:14] He shot his arrows and scattered them,
|    flashed lightnings, and routed them.
|   [18:15] The channels of the sea were revealed,
|    the world was laid bare to its base,
|  at your rebuke, O LORD,
|    at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.

|   [18:16] He stretched from on high, he seized me,
|    drew me up from the mighty waters,
|   [18:17] and saved me from those who hated me —
|    fierce foes, too mighty for me.
|   [18:18] In my day of distress they assailed me,
|    but the LORD proved my support.
|   [18:19] To a spacious place he brought me,
|    and, for love of me, he saved me.

|   [18:20] The LORD repays my innocence,
|    he rewards my cleanness of hands.
|   [18:21] For I kept the ways of the LORD,
|    nor have wickedly strayed from my God.
|   [18:22] His commandments were all before me,
|    his statutes I put not away.
|   [18:23] And I was blameless before him,
|    guarding myself from sin.
|   [18:24] So the LORD repaid my innocence,
|    my cleanness of hands in his sight.
