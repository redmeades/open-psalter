##### Psalm 6 — A Cry for Help in Time of Trouble #####

For the leader; with instrumental music on the sheminith. A psalm of David.

|   [6:1] Rebuke me not, LORD, in your anger,
|    punish me not in your wrath.
|   [6:2] LORD, be gracious to me
|    in my weakness.
|  Heal me LORD,
|    for racked is my body;
|   [6:3] all of me utterly racked.
|    Why do you wait so long, LORD ?

|   [6:4] Turn, LORD, rescue me;
|    save me, because of your love.
|   [6:5] For in death none can call you to mind;
|    in Sheol who can praise you?

|   [6:6] I am so weary of sighing.
|    All the night I make my bed swim,
|    and wet my couch with my tears.
|   [6:7] My eyes swollen with grief;
|    from weeping caused by my foes.

|   [6:8] Begone, workers of wrong,
|    for the LORD has heard my loud weeping,
|   [6:9] the LORD has heard my entreaty,
|    the LORD accepts my prayer.
|   [6:10] My foes will be stricken with terror,
|    brought to shame and dismay in a moment.

##### Psalm 8 — God’s Glory in Nature #####

For the leader: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by a stringed instrument.

|   [8:1] LORD our God!
|    How glorious in all the earth is your name!
|  Your praise reaches as high as the heavens,
|     [8:2] from the mouths of children and infants.

|  You have built a fortress
|    against your enemies,
|  to silence the foe and the rebel.

|   [8:3] When I look at your heavens,
|    the work of your fingers,
|  the moon and the stars,
|    which you have set there,
|   [8:4] what are mortals,
|    that you think of them,
|  humans,
|    that you visit them?

|   [8:5] Yet you made them little less than divine,
|    crowned them with glory and majesty,
|   [8:6] made them lord of the works of your hands,
|    put all things under their feet —
|   [8:7] sheep and oxen,
|    all of them;
|  and the wild beasts also:
|     [8:8] birds of the air,
|    and fish of the sea,
|    and all that crosses the paths of the ocean.

|   [8:9] LORD our God!
|    How glorious in all the earth is your name!

##### Psalm 22 — The Sufferer’s Triumph #####

For the leader; set to “Deer of the Dawn”. A psalm of David.

|   [22:1] My God, my God, why have you left me,
|    my rescue so far from the words of my roaring?
|   [22:2] I cry in the day, you do not answer,
|  I cry in the night but find no rest.

|   [22:3] You are the Holy One,
|    throned on the praises of Israel.
|   [22:4] In you our ancestors trusted,
|    they trusted and you delivered them.
|   [22:5] They cried to you, and found safety,
|    in you did they trust and were not put to shame.

|   [22:6] But I am a worm, not a person;
|    insulted by others, despised by the people.
|   [22:7] All who see me mock me,
|    with mouths wide open and wagging heads:
|   [22:8] ‘He relies on the LORD ; let him save him.
|    Let him rescue the one he holds dear!’

|   [22:9] But you drew me from the womb,
|    laid me safely on my mother’s breasts.
|   [22:10] On your care was I cast from my very birth,
|    you are my God from my mother’s womb.
|   [22:11] Be not far from me, for trouble is nigh,
|  and there is none to help.

|   [22:12] I am circled by many bulls,
|    beset by the mighty of Bashan,
|   [22:13] who face me with gaping jaws,
|    like ravening roaring lions.
|   [22:14] Poured out am I like water,
|    and all my bones are loosened.
|  My heart is become like wax,
|    melted within me.

|   [22:15] My palate is dry as a sherd,
|    my tongue sticks to my jaws;
|    in the dust of death you lay me.
|   [22:16] For dogs are round about me,
|    a band of knaves encircles me,
|    gnawing my hands and my feet.
|   [22:17] I can count my bones, every one.
|    As for them, they feast their eyes on me.
|   [22:18] They divide my garments among them,
|    and over my raiment cast lots.

|   [22:19] But you, O LORD, be not far,
|    O my strength, hasten to help me.
|   [22:20] Deliver my life from the sword
|    my life from the power of the dogs.
|   [22:21] Save me from the jaws of the lion,
|    from the horns of the wild oxen help me.

|   [22:22] I will tell of your fame to my kindred,
|    and in the assembly will praise you.
|   [22:23] Praise the LORD, you who fear him.
|    All Jacob’s seed, give him glory.
|    All Israel’s seed, stand in awe of him.

|   [22:24] For he has not despised nor abhorred
|    the sorrow of the sorrowful.
|  He hid not his face from me,
|    but he listened to my cry for help.

|   [22:25] Of you is my praise in the great congregation;
|    my vows I will pay before those who fear him.
|   [22:26] The afflicted will eat to their heart’s desire,
|    and those who seek after the LORD will praise him.
|    Lift up your hearts forever.
|   [22:27] All will call it to mind, to the ends of the earth,
|    and turn to the LORD ;
|  and all tribes of the nations will bow down before you.
|   [22:28] For the kingdom belongs to the LORD :
|    he is the LORD of the nations.
|   [22:29] To him will bow down all who sleep in the earth,
|    and before him bend all who go down to the dust,
|    and those who could not preserve their lives.
|   [22:30] My descendents will tell of the LORD
|     to the next generation;
|   [22:31] they will declare his righteousness
|    to people yet to be born:
|    He has done it.
