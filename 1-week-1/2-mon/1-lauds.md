##### Psalm 24 — The True Worshipper #####

Of David. A psalm.

|   [24:1] The earth is the LORD’s and all that it holds,
|    the world and those who live in it.
|   [24:2] For he founded it on the seas,
|    and on the floods he sustains it.

|   [24:3] Who may ascend the hill of the LORD ?
|    Who may stand in his holy place?
|   [24:4] The clean of hands, the pure of heart,
|    who sets not their heart upon sinful things,
|    nor swears with intent to deceive:
|   [24:5] they win from the LORD a blessing:
|    God is their champion and saviour.
|   [24:6] Such must be those who resort to him,
|    and seek the face of the God of Jacob. (Selah)

##### The Lords’s Triumphal Entry into the Sanctuary #####

|   [24:7] Lift high your heads, you gates —
|    Higher, you ancient doors;
|    welcome the glorious king.
|   [24:8] ‘Who is the glorious king?’
|    ‘The LORD strong and heroic,
|    the LORD heroic in battle.’

|   [24:9] Lift high your heads, you gates —
|    Higher, you ancient doors;
|    welcome the glorious king.
|   [24:10] ‘Who is the glorious king?’
|    ‘The LORD, the God of hosts,
|    he is the glorious king.’ (Selah)

##### Psalm 3 — A Morning Prayer for Protection #####

A psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.

|   [3:1] How many, LORD, are my foes!
|    Those who rise up against me are many.
|   [3:2] Many are those who say of me,
|    ‘There is no help for him in his God.’ (Selah)

|   [3:3] But you, LORD, are shield about me,
|    my glory, who lifts up my head.
|   [3:4] When loudly I call to the LORD,
|    from his holy hill he gives answer. (Selah)

|   [3:5] I laid down and slept:
|    now I wake, for the LORD sustains me.
|   [3:6] I fear not the myriads of people
|    who beset me on every side.

|   [3:7] Arise, LORD : save me, my God,
|    who strikes all my foes on the cheek,
|    and shatters the teeth of the wicked.
|   [3:8] Victory belongs to the LORD :
|    let your blessing descend on your people. (Selah)

##### Psalm 5 — A Prayer for Guidance #####

For the leader: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by the flute.

|   [5:1] Hear my words, LORD :
|    give heed to my whisper.
|   [5:2] Attend to my loud cry for help,
|    my king and my God.
|   [5:3] When I pray to you, LORD, in the morning,
|    hear my voice.
|  I make ready for you in the morning,
|    and look for a sign.

|   [5:4] For you are no God who takes pleasure in wickedness:
|    no one of evil can be your guest.
|   [5:5] No braggarts can stand in your presence,
|    you hate all workers of wrong.
|   [5:6] You destroy all speakers of lies,
|    people of blood and deceit you abhor.
|   [5:7] But I, through your kindness abundant,
|    may enter your house,
|  and towards the shrine of your temple
|    may reverently bow.

|   [5:8] Lead me, LORD, in your righteousness
|    because of my enemies.
|    Make your way level before me.
|   [5:9] For their mouth is a stranger to truth,
|    their heart is a pit of destruction.
|  Their throat is a wide open grave,
|    their tongue the smooth tongue of the hypocrite.

|   [5:10] Condemn them, God;
|    let their schemes bring them down to the ground.
|  For their numberless crimes thrust them down
|    for playing the rebel against you.
|   [5:11] But let all who take refuge in you
|    ring out their gladness forever.
|  Protect those who love your name,
|    so they may exult in you.
|   [5:12] For you give your blessing, LORD, to the godly,
|    and the shield of your favour protects them.

##### Psalm 11 — Trust in the Lord #####

For the leader. Of David.

|   [11:1] In the LORD I take refuge.
|    How can you tell me
|  to flee like a bird to the mountains?

|   [11:2] ‘See! The wicked are bending the bow,
|    their arrow is set on the string,
|    to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.
|   [11:3] In this tearing down of foundations
|    what good can a good person do?’

|   [11:4] The LORD in his holy temple,
|    the LORD in heaven, enthroned.
|  His eyes watch the world,
|    they see everyone.
|   [11:5] The LORD examines the righteous and wicked,
|    and the lover of violence he hates.
|   [11:6] On the wicked he rains coals of fire and brimstone,
|    and their drink will be scorching wind.
|   [11:7] For the LORD is just, and justice he loves;
|    so the upright will see his face.

##### Psalm 146 — The Great Protector #####

|   [146:1] My soul, praise the LORD .
|     [146:2] I will praise the LORD, while I live;
|  I will sing to my God, while I am.

|   [146:3] Put not your trust in princes
|    mortals, in whom is no help.
|   [146:4] When their breath goes out,
|    they go back to the dust:
|  on that very day
|    their purposes perish.
|     [146:5] Happy those whose help
|    is the God of Jacob:
|  whose hope is set
|    on the LORD their God,
|   [146:6] the Creator of heaven and earth,
|    the sea, and all that is in them.

|  He remains eternally loyal.
|     [146:7] For the wronged he executes justice;
|  he gives bread to the hungry;
|    the LORD releases the prisoners.
|   [146:8] The LORD gives sight to the blind:
|    the LORD raises those who are bowed.
|  The LORD loves the righteous.
|     [146:9] The LORD preserves the stranger,
|  upholds the widow and orphan,
|    but the wicked he leads to disaster.

|   [146:10] The LORD shall reign forever,
|    your God, O Zion, to all generations.
|      Hallelujah.
