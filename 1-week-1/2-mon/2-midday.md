##### Psalm 1 — The Way of Happiness #####

|   [1:1] Happy are those
|    who do not follow the counsel of the wicked,
|  not halting in ways frequented by sinners,
|    nor taking a seat in a gathering of scoffers.
|   [1:2] But the law of the LORD is their joy,
|    they study it day and night.
|   [1:3] They are like trees
|    planted by runlets of water,
|  yielding fruit in due season,
|    leaves never fading.
|    In all that they do, they prosper.

|   [1:4] Not so fare the wicked, not so;
|    like chaff are they, blown by the wind.
|   [1:5] So the wicked will not stand firm in the judgment,
|    nor sinners appear, when the righteous are gathered.
|   [1:6] For the way of the righteous is dear to the LORD,
|    but the way of the wicked will end in ruin.

##### Psalm 2 — The Lord’s Chosen King #####

|   [2:1] Why this turmoil of nations,
|    this futile plotting of peoples,
|   [2:2] with kings of the earth conspiring,
|    and rulers consulting together,
|    against the LORD and against his anointed,
|   [2:3] to snap their bonds
|    and fling their cords away?

|   [2:4] He whose throne is in heaven laughs,
|    the LORD mocks them.
|   [2:5] Then he speaks to them in his wrath,
|    and in his hot anger confounds them.
|   [2:6] ‘This my king is installed by me,
|    on Zion my holy mountain.’

|   [2:7] I will tell of the LORD’s decree.
|  He said to me: ‘You are my son,
|    this day I became your father.
|   [2:8] Only ask, and I make you the heir of the nations,
|    and lord of the world to its utmost bounds.
|   [2:9] You will break them with sceptre of iron,
|    shatter them like pottery.’

|   [2:10] So now, you kings, be wise:
|    be warned, you rulers of earth.
|   [2:11] Serve the LORD in awe,
|    kiss his feet with trembling,
|   [2:12] lest, angry, he hurl you to ruin;
|    for soon will his fury blaze.
|    Happy all who take refuge in him.

##### Psalm 12 — A Prayer for the Faithful in a False World #####

For the leader; on the sheminith. A psalm of David.

|   [12:1] Help, LORD, for the good are all gone,
|    faithful people have vanished.
|   [12:2] One lies to another, speaking empty lies,
|    with flattering lips and false hearts they speak.

|   [12:3] May the LORD cut off all the flattering lips,
|    and the tongue that utters arrogance,
|   [12:4] they declare, ‘Our tongue is our strength,
|    our allies our lips: who is lord over us?’

|   [12:5] ‘The poor are despoiled, and the needy are sighing;
|    so now I will act,’ the LORD declares
|    ‘And place them in the safety they long for.’

|   [12:6] The words of the LORD are words that are pure,
|    silver smelted, seven times refined.
|   [12:7] You will keep us, LORD,
|    and guard us from this generation forever,
|   [12:8] in a world where the wicked prowl,
|    and worthless people exalted.

##### Psalm 13 — A Prayer for Help in Trouble #####

For the leader. A psalm of David.

|   [13:1] How long, LORD, will you forget me forever?
|    How long will you hide your face from me?
|   [13:2] How long must I nurse grief inside me,
|    and in my heart a daily sorrow?
|    How long are my foes to exult over me?

|   [13:3] Look at me, answer me, LORD my God.
|  Fill my eyes with your light,
|    lest I sleep in death,
|     [13:4] lest my enemies claim to have triumphed,
|    lest my foes rejoice at my downfall.

|   [13:5] But I trust in your kindness:
|    my heart will rejoice in your help.
|     [13:6] I will sing to the LORD who was good to me.
