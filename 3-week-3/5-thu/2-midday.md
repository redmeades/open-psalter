##### Psalm 119.105-136 — The Power and Comfort of the Word of God #####

|   [119:105] Your word is a lamp to my feet,
|    and a light to my path.
|   [119:106] I have sworn an oath, and will keep it,
|    to observe your righteous judgments.
|   [119:107] I am afflicted sorely:
|    revive me, O LORD, as you said.
|   [119:108] Accept, LORD, my willing praise,
|    and teach me your judgments.
|   [119:109] My life is in ceaseless peril;
|    but I do not forget your law.
|   [119:110] The wicked set traps for me,
|    yet I do not stray from your precepts.
|   [119:111] In your charges are my everlasting inheritance,
|    they are the joy of my heart.
|   [119:112] I am resolved to perform your statutes
|    forever, to the utmost.

|   [119:113] I hate people of divided heart,
|    but your law do I love.
|   [119:114] You are my shelter and shield:
|    in your word do I hope.
|   [119:115] Begone, you wicked people,
|    I will keep the commands of my God.
|   [119:116] Uphold me and spare me, as you have promised:
|    O disappoint me not.
|   [119:117] Hold me up, and I shall be saved:
|    and your statutes shall be my unceasing delight.
|   [119:118] All who swerve from your statutes you spurn:
|    their cunning is in vain.
|   [119:119] All the wicked of earth you count as dross,
|    therefore I love your charges.
|   [119:120] My flesh, for fear of you, shudders,
|    and I stand in awe of your judgments.

|   [119:121] Justice and right have I practised,
|    do not leave me to my oppressors.
|   [119:122] Be your servant’s surety for good:
|    ‘Let not the proud oppress me.
|   [119:123] My eyes pine for your salvation,
|    and for your righteous promise.
|   [119:124] Deal in your love with your servant,
|    and teach me your statutes.
|   [119:125] Your servant am I; instruct me,
|    that I may know your charges.
|   [119:126] It is time for the LORD to act:
|    they have violated your law.
|   [119:127] Therefore I love your commandments
|    above gold, above fine gold.
|   [119:128] So by all your precepts I guide me,
|    and every false way I hate.

|   [119:129] Your decrees are wonderful,
|    gladly I keep them.
|   [119:130] When your word is unfolded, light breaks;
|    it imparts to the simple wisdom.
|   [119:131] With open mouth I pant
|    with longing for your commandments.
|   [119:132] Turn to me with your favour,
|    as is just to those who love you.
|   [119:133] Steady my steps by your word,
|    so that sin have no power over me.
|   [119:134] Set me free from those who oppress me,
|    and I shall observe your precepts.
|   [119:135] Shine with your face on your servant,
|    and teach me your statutes.
|   [119:136] My eyes run down with rills of water,
|    because your law is not kept.
