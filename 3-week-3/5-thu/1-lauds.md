##### Psalm 80 — A Prayer for the Preservation of Israel #####

For the leader. On shoshannim, eduth. Of Asaph, a psalm.

|   [80:1] Listen, Shepherd of Israel,
|    who leads Joseph like a flock of sheep;
|  from your throne on the cherubs shine forth
|     [80:2] before Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin.
|  Stir up your mighty power,
|    come to our help.
|   [80:3] God, restore us:
|    show us the light of your face,
|    so we may be saved.

|   [80:4] O LORD of hosts,
|  how long is your anger to smoke,
|    despite the prayer of your people?
|   [80:5] You have fed them with bread of tears,
|    you have made them drink tears by the measure.
|   [80:6] The scorn of our neighbours you make us,
|    the laughing-stock of our foes.
|   [80:7] God of hosts, restore us:
|    show us the light of your face,
|    so we may be saved.

|   [80:8] A vine out of Egypt you brought;
|    you did drive out the nations, and plant her;
|   [80:9] in the ground you did clear she struck root,
|    and she filled all the land.
|   [80:10] The shade of her covered the mountains,
|    her branches the cedars of God.
|   [80:11] She sent forth her shoots to the sea,
|    and her branches as far as the River.
|   [80:12] Why have you torn down her fences, and left her
|    to be plucked at by all who pass by,
|   [80:13] to be gnawed by the boar from the forest,
|    and devoured by the beasts of the field?

|   [80:14] O God of hosts, return:
|    look down from heaven and see
|  and visit this vine, and restore her
|     [80:15] the vine which your right hand has planted.
|   [80:16] She is burned with fire and cut down
|    before your stern face they are perishing.
|   [80:17] Support the one you have chosen,
|    the one you have raised for yourself;
|   [80:18] then from you we will never draw back.
|    Preserve us, and we will call on your name.
|   [80:19] LORD, God of hosts, restore us:
|    Show us the light of your face,
|    so we may be saved.

#### Psalm 86 — A Prayer for Divine Guidance and Favour #####

A prayer of David.

|   [86:1] Incline your ear, LORD, and answer me,
|    for I am afflicted and needy.
|   [86:2] Guard me, for I am loyal:
|    save your servant, who trusts in you.
|   [86:3] LORD, be gracious to me, for you are my God;
|    I cry to you all the day.
|   [86:4] Gladden the heart of your servant;
|    for to you, LORD, I set my hope.
|   [86:5] For you, LORD, are good and forgiving,
|    rich in love towards all who call on you.

|   [86:6] Listen, O LORD, to my prayer;
|    attend to my plea for mercy.
|   [86:7] In the day of my trouble I call on you,
|    with assurance that you will answer me.
|   [86:8] None of the gods is like you, LORD,
|    nor are any works like yours.
|   [86:9] All the nations you have made
|    will come and bow down before you,
|    giving glory, O LORD, to your name.
|   [86:10] For great are you, and a doer of wonders;
|    you alone are God.

|   [86:11] Teach me, O LORD, your way,
|    that I may walk in your truth:
|    so my heart shall rejoice in your name.
|   [86:12] I will give you thanks, O LORD,
|    with all my heart, my God,
|    I will honour your name forever.
|   [86:13] For great is your love towards me,
|    from the depths of Sheol you have saved me.

|   [86:14] Haughty men have risen up against me, O God,
|    a band of the violent seeking my life,
|    who think nothing of you.
|   [86:15] But you are a God of pity and grace,
|    patient and rich in kindness and faithfulness;
|    turn to me with your grace, O LORD .
|   [86:16] Grant your strength to your servant,
|    and save the child of your handmaid.
|   [86:17] Show me a sign of your favour,
|    which those who hate me may see with confusion,
|    since you, LORD, are my helper and comforter.

##### Psalm 148 — The Universal Chorus of Praise #####

|   [148:1] Praise the LORD from the heavens,
|    praise him in the heights.
|   [148:2] Praise him, all his angels;
|    praise him, all his hosts.

|   [148:3] Praise him, sun and moon;
|    praise him, all stars of light.
|   [148:4] Praise him, you highest heavens,
|    and you waters above the heavens.

|   [148:5] Let them praise the name of the LORD,
|    for at his command they were made.

|    by a law which they dare not transgress.

|   [148:7] Praise the LORD from the earth:
|    you depths, with your monsters, all.
|   [148:8] Fire, hail, snow and ice,
|    and stormy wind doing his word.

|   [148:9] All you mountains and hills,
|    all you fruit trees and cedars,
|   [148:10] all you wild beasts and tame,
|    creeping things, birds on the wing.

|   [148:11] All you kings and nations of earth;
|    all you princes and judges of earth:
|   [148:12] young men and maidens together,
|    old men and children together.

|   [148:13] Let them praise the name of the LORD,
|    for his name alone is exalted.
|  Over heaven and earth is his glory.
|     [148:14] He has lifted his people to honour.
|  Wherefore this chorus of praise from his saints,
|    from Israel, the people who stand in his fellowship.
|      Hallelujah.
