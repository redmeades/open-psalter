##### Psalm 105 — The Inspiration of the Past #####

|   [105:1] Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name:
|    make known his deeds among the nations.
|   [105:2] Sing to him, make music to him,
|    tell of all his wondrous works.
|   [105:3] Make your boast in his holy name,
|    be glad at heart, you who seek the LORD .
|   [105:4] Seek after the LORD and his strength,
|    seek his face evermore.
|   [105:5] Remember the wonders he did,
|    his portents, the judgments he uttered,
|   [105:6] you who are offspring of Abraham, his servant,
|    the children of Jacob, his chosen ones.

|   [105:7] He is the LORD our God:
|    in all the earth are his judgments.
|   [105:8] He remembers forever his covenant,
|    his promise for a thousand generations
|   [105:9] The covenant he made with Abraham,
|    the oath he swore to Isaac,
|   [105:10] and confirmed as a statute to Jacob,
|    a pact everlasting to Israel
|   [105:11] to give them the land of Canaan
|    as the lot which they should inherit.

|   [105:12] And when they were very few,
|    few and but pilgrims therein,
|   [105:13] wandering from nation to nation,
|    journeying from people to people,
|   [105:14] he allowed no one to oppress them,
|    even punishing kings for their sakes.
|   [105:15] He forbade them to touch his anointed,
|    or do any hurt to his prophets.

|   [105:16] When he called down famine on the land,
|    and cut off the bread which sustained them,
|   [105:17] he sent before them a man,
|    Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
|   [105:18] His feet were galled with fetters,
|    he was laid in chains of iron,
|   [105:19] till the time that his word came to pass,
|    the word of the LORD that had tried him.

|   [105:20] The king sent and freed him,
|    the ruler of nations released him.
|   [105:21] He made him lord of his household,
|    and ruler of all his possessions,
|   [105:22] to admonish his princes at will
|    and instruct his elders in wisdom.

|   [105:23] Thus Israel came into Egypt,
|    Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
|   [105:24] His people he made very fruitful,
|    and mightier than their foes.
|   [105:25] He inspired them to hate his people,
|    and to deal with his servants craftily.

|   [105:26] He sent his servant Moses,
|    and Aaron whom he had chosen,
|   [105:27] portents he wrought in Egypt,
|    and signs in the land of Ham.
|   [105:28] Darkness he sent, and it fell:
|    yet they gave no heed to his word.

|   [105:29] He turned their waters into blood,
|    thus causing their fish to die.
|   [105:30] Their land was alive with frogs,
|    swarming even in the royal chambers.
|   [105:31] At his command came flies,
|    and lice in all their borders.
|   [105:32] He gave them hail for rain
|    and fire that flashed through the land,
|   [105:33] smiting their vines and figs,
|    breaking the trees of their border.

|   [105:34] At his command came locusts,
|    young locusts beyond all counting,
|   [105:35] which ate every herb in the land,
|    ate up, too, the fruit of their ground.
|   [105:36] He struck down in their land all the first-born,
|    the firstlings of all their strength
|   [105:37] Then forth he led Israel with silver and gold,
|    and among his tribes no one was weary.

|   [105:38] Egypt was glad when they left,
|    for terror had fallen upon them.
|   [105:39] He spread out a cloud to screen them,
|    and fire to give light in the night.
|   [105:40] He sent quails at their entreaty,
|    and heavenly bread in abundance.
|   [105:41] He opened the rock; waters gushed:
|    in the desert they ran like a river.
|   [105:42] For he remembered his holy promise
|    to Abraham his servant.

|   [105:43] So he led out his people with joy,
|    his elect with a ringing cry.
|   [105:44] And he gave them the lands of the nations,
|    the fruit of their toil for possession,
|   [105:45] that so they might keep his statutes,
|    and be of his laws observant.
|      Hallelujah.

##### Psalm 108 — A Prayer for Victory #####

 A song. A psalm of David.

 |   [108:1] My heart is steadfast, O God,
 |    my heart is steadfast.
 |  I would sing, I would make music;
 |    awake, my soul.
 |   [108:2] Awake, harp and lyre;
 |    I would wake the dawn.
 |   [108:3] I would praise you among the peoples, O LORD ;
 |    make music among the nations to you.
 |   [108:4] For great to heaven is your love,
 |    and your faithfulness to the clouds.
 |   [108:5] Be exalted, O God, o”er the heavens,
 |    and your glory o”er all the earth.

 |   [108:6] So those you love may be rescued,
 |    save by your right hand and answer us.
 |   [108:7] God did solemnly swear:
 |    ‘As victor will I divide Shechem,
 |  portion out the valley of Succoth.
 |     [108:8] Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh,
 |  Ephraim is my helmet,
 |    Judah my sceptre of rule,
 |   [108:9] Moab the pot that I wash in,
 |    on Edom I hurl my sandal,
 |    I shout o”er Philistia in triumph.’

 |   [108:10] O to be brought to the fortified city!
 |    O to be led into Edom!
 |   [108:11] Have you not spurned us, O God?
 |    You do not march forth with our armies.

 |   [108:12] Grant us help from the foe,
 |    for human help is worthless.
 |   [108:13] With God we shall yet do bravely,
 |    he himself will tread down our foes.
