##### Psalm 110 — A Promise of Victory to the King #####

Of David, a psalm.

|   [110:1] This said the LORD concerning my lord,
|    ‘Sit at my right hand,
|    till I set your foot on the neck of your foes.’

|   [110:2] On Zion the LORD is wielding
|    your sceptre of might, and charges you
|    to rule over the foes that surround you.

|   [110:3] The day that you march to battle
|    your people will follow you gladly
|  young warriors in holy array,
|    like dew-drops, born of the morning.

|   [110:4] The LORD has sworn and will not repent,
|    ‘As for you, you are priest for ever
|    as Melchizedek was.’

|   [110:5] By your side will the LORD shatter kings
|    on the day of his wrath.
|   [110:6] He will execute judgment
|    filling the valleys with dead,
|    the broad fields with shattered heads.
|   [110:7] He will drink of the brook by the way,
|    and march onward with uplifted head.

##### Psalm 111 — In Praise of the Divine Goodness #####

|       [111:1] Hallelujah.

|  I will thank the LORD with all my heart,
|    in the assembled congregation of his people.
|   [111:2] Great are the things that the LORD has done,
|    worthy of study by those who love them.
|   [111:3] Majestic and glorious is his work,
|    and his righteousness abides forever.
|   [111:4] For his marvellous deeds he has won renown;
|    the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.
|   [111:5] Food he gives to those who fear him,
|    always he remembers his covenant.
|   [111:6] His mighty works he has shown to his people,
|    in giving to them the nations for heritage.
|   [111:7] All that he does is faithful and right,
|    all his behests are firm and sure.
|   [111:8] They are established for ever and ever,
|    executed with truth and uprightness.
|   [111:9] To his people he sent redemption,
|    he has appointed his covenant forever.
|  His name is holy and awe-inspiring.
|     [111:10] The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom
|  those who keep it are wise indeed.
|    His praise abides for ever and ever.

##### Psalm 112 — The Blessings of Godliness #####

|       [112:1] Hallelujah.Happy are those who fear the LORD,
|    and greatly delight in his commandments.

|   [112:2] Mighty on earth shall be their seed;
|    a blessing shall rest on the race of the upright.
|   [112:3] Wealth and riches are in their houses,
|    their prosperity stands forever.
|   [112:4] To the upright arises light in the darkness;
|    full of favour and pity and kindness are they.
|   [112:5] It is well with those who show pity and lend,
|    who support all their affairs upon justice.
|   [112:6] For they will never be shaken;
|    the just will be forever remembered.
|   [112:7] They will not be afraid of evil tidings,
|    with steady heart they trust the LORD .
|   [112:8] Their heart is firm and unafraid:
|    they know they will feast their eyes on their enemies.
|     [112:9] With lavish hands they give to the poor,
|  and their prosperity stands forever.
|    They are lifted to heights of triumph and honour.
|   [112:10] The sight of them fills the wicked with anger:
|    grinding their teeth with dispair.
|    The hopes of the wicked will come to nothing.

##### Psalm 113 — The Lord loves the Humble #####

|       [113:1] Hallelujah.

|  Praise the LORD, you his servants,
|    praise the name of the LORD .
|   [113:2] The name of the LORD be blessed
|    from now and for evermore.
|   [113:3] From sunrise to sunset
|    is the name of the LORD to be praised.

|   [113:4] High is the LORD above all nations,
|    above the heavens is his glory.
|   [113:5] Who is like the LORD our God,
|    seated on high?
|   [113:6] He bends down to look
|    at the heavens and earth.

|   [113:7] He raises the weak from the dust,
|    he lifts the poor from the dunghill,
|   [113:8] and sets them beside the princes,
|    even the princes of his people.
|   [113:9] He gives the childless woman a home,
|    and makes her the happy mother of children.
|      Hallelujah.
