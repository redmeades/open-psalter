##### Psalm 24 — The True Worshipper #####

Of David. A psalm.

|   [24:1] The earth is the LORD’s and all that it holds,
|    the world and those who live in it.
|   [24:2] For he founded it on the seas,
|    and on the floods he sustains it.

|   [24:3] Who may ascend the hill of the LORD ?
|    Who may stand in his holy place?
|   [24:4] The clean of hands, the pure of heart,
|    who sets not their heart upon sinful things,
|    nor swears with intent to deceive:
|   [24:5] they win from the LORD a blessing:
|    God is their champion and saviour.
|   [24:6] Such must be those who resort to him,
|    and seek the face of the God of Jacob. (Selah)

##### The Lords’s Triumphal Entry into the Sanctuary #####

|   [24:7] Lift high your heads, you gates —
|    Higher, you ancient doors;
|    welcome the glorious king.
|   [24:8] ‘Who is the glorious king?’
|    ‘The LORD strong and heroic,
|    the LORD heroic in battle.’

|   [24:9] Lift high your heads, you gates —
|    Higher, you ancient doors;
|    welcome the glorious king.
|   [24:10] ‘Who is the glorious king?’
|    ‘The LORD, the God of hosts,
|    he is the glorious king.’ (Selah)


##### Psalm 61 — Our God is a Strong Tower #####

For the leader. On stringed instruments. Of David.

|   [61:1] Hear my cry, O God,
|    be attentive to my prayer.
|   [61:2] From the ends of the earth I call
|    unto you, when my heart is faint:
|  lead me to the rock
|    that is high above me.
|   [61:3] For you are a refuge to me,
|    a strong tower in face of the foe.

|   [61:4] O to be guest in your tent forever,
|    hiding beneath your sheltering wings! (Selah)
|   [61:5] For you, O God, do hear my vows,
|    and grant the desires of those who fear you.
|   [61:6] Add many days to the life of the king;
|    may his years endure throughout all generations.
|   [61:7] In the presence of God be he throned forever;
|    may kindness and faithfulness watch over him.
|   [61:8] And I will sing praise to your name forever,
|    paying my vows day after day.

##### Psalm 71 — Forsake me not, when I am Old #####

|   [71:1] In you, O LORD, I take refuge,
|    let me never be put to shame.
|   [71:2] In your faithfulness save me and rescue me,
|    bend your ear to me and save me.
|   [71:3] Be to me a rock of defence,
|    a fortified house, to save me;
|    for my rock and my fortress are you.

|   [71:4] Save me, my God, from the hand of the wicked,
|    from the grasp of the unjust and cruel.
|   [71:5] For you, LORD, are my hope,
|    in whom from my youth I have trusted.
|   [71:6] On you have I leaned from my birth;
|    from my mother’s womb it was you who did draw me.
|    In you is my hope evermore.

|   [71:7] I have been as a wonder to many,
|    for you are my refuge and strength.
|   [71:8] All the day long my mouth
|    is filled with your praise and your glory.
|   [71:9] Cast me not off in the time of old age;
|    when my strength is spent, forsake me not.
|   [71:10] For my foes whisper against me,
|    they who watch me take counsel together;
|   [71:11] ‘God has left him,’ they say: ‘pursue
|    and seize him, for he is helpless.’

|   [71:12] O God, be not far from me,
|    haste, O my God, to my help.
|   [71:13] Put my foes to shame and dishonour,
|    with insult and shame be they covered.
|   [71:14] But I will never stop hoping,
|    and more and yet more will I praise you.
|   [71:15] All the day long shall my mouth
|    tell your faithfulness and your salvation,
|    though I know not how they may be counted.

|   [71:16] I will tell of the might of the LORD,
|    and your faithfulness praise, you alone.
|   [71:17] You have taught me, O God, from my youth,
|    and till now have I told of your wonders.
|   [71:18] Even in old age and grey hair,
|    O God, do not forsake me.
|  Still would I tell of your might
|    unto all generations to come.

|   [71:19] Your power and your justice, O God,
|    extend as far as the heavens:
|  for great are the things you have done.
|    Who is like you, O God?
|   [71:20] You have caused us to see troubles many,
|    but you will revive us again.
|  From the depths of the earth
|    you will bring me up again.
|   [71:21] You will multiply my greatness,
|    and comfort me again.

|   [71:22] So with harp I will praise you,
|    and your faithfulness, O my God;
|  and make music to you on the lyre,
|    O you Holy One of Israel.
|   [71:23] My lips shall ring out their joy,
|    my mouth shall sing praises to you;
|    all of me, which you have redeemed.
|   [71:24] Yes, all the day long shall my tongue
|    utter your righteousness;
|  for ashamed and confounded are they
|    who were seeking my hurt.

##### Psalm 146 — The Great Protector #####

|   [146:1] My soul, praise the LORD .
|     [146:2] I will praise the LORD, while I live;
|  I will sing to my God, while I am.

|   [146:3] Put not your trust in princes
|    mortals, in whom is no help.
|   [146:4] When their breath goes out,
|    they go back to the dust:
|  on that very day
|    their purposes perish.
|     [146:5] Happy those whose help
|    is the God of Jacob:
|  whose hope is set
|    on the LORD their God,
|   [146:6] the Creator of heaven and earth,
|    the sea, and all that is in them.

|  He remains eternally loyal.
|     [146:7] For the wronged he executes justice;
|  he gives bread to the hungry;
|    the LORD releases the prisoners.
|   [146:8] The LORD gives sight to the blind:
|    the LORD raises those who are bowed.
|  The LORD loves the righteous.
|     [146:9] The LORD preserves the stranger,
|  upholds the widow and orphan,
|    but the wicked he leads to disaster.

|   [146:10] The LORD shall reign forever,
|    your God, O Zion, to all generations.
|      Hallelujah.
