##### Psalm 119.1-40 â€” The Power and Comfort of the Word of God #####

|   [119:1] Happy they whose life is blameless,
|    who walk by the law of the LORD .
|   [119:2] Happy they who keep his charges,
|    and seek him with all their hearts;
|   [119:3] who have done no wrong,
|    but walk in his ways.
|   [119:4] You yourself have appointed your precepts
|    to be kept with diligence.

|   [119:5] O to be steadily guided
|    in the keeping of your statutes!
|   [119:6] Then unashamed shall I be,
|    when I look towards all your commandments.
|   [119:7] I will thank you with heart unfeigned,
|    when I learn your righteous judgments.
|   [119:8] I will observe your statutes:
|    O forsake me not utterly.

|   [119:9] How can a young person keep their life pure?
|    By giving heed to your word.
|   [119:10] With all my heart have I sought you,
|    let me not stray from your commandments.
|   [119:11] In my heart have I treasured your word,
|    to keep from sinning against you.
|   [119:12] Blessed are you, O LORD ;
|    teach me your statutes.
|   [119:13] With my lips have I rehearsed
|    all the judgments of your mouth.
|   [119:14] I delight in the way of your charges,
|    more than in riches of all sorts.
|   [119:15] I will muse upon your precepts,
|    and look to your paths.
|   [119:16] In your statutes I delight,
|    I will not forget your word.

|   [119:17] Grant that your servant may live,
|    and I will observe your word.
|   [119:18] Open my eyes, that I see
|    wondrous things out of your law.
|   [119:19] But a guest am I on the earth:
|    hide not your commandments from me.
|   [119:20] My heart is crushed with longing
|    for your ordinances, at all times.
|   [119:21] You rebuke the proud, the accursed,
|    who wander from your commandments.
|   [119:22] Roll away from me scorn and contempt,
|    for I have observed your charges.
|   [119:23] Though princes sit plotting against me,
|    your servant will muse on your statutes.
|   [119:24] Your charges are my delight,
|    they are my counsellors.

|   [119:25] I lie grovelling in the dust;
|    revive me, as you have promised.
|   [119:26] I told of my ways, you made answer;
|    teach me your statutes.
|   [119:27] Grant me insight into your precepts,
|    and I will muse on your wonders.
|   [119:28] I am overcome with sorrow;
|    raise me up, as you have promised.
|   [119:29] Put the way of falsehood from me,
|    and graciously grant me your law.
|   [119:30] I have chosen the way of fidelity,
|    your ordinances I long for.
|   [119:31] I hold fast to your charges:
|    O put me not, LORD, to shame.
|   [119:32] I will run in the way of your commandments,
|    for you give me room of heart.

|   [119:33] Teach me, O LORD, the way of your statutes,
|    and I will keep it to the end,
|   [119:34] instruct me to keep your law,
|    and I will observe it with all my heart.
|   [119:35] Guide me in the path of your commandments,
|    for therein do I delight.
|   [119:36] Incline my heart to your charges,
|    and not to greed of gain.
|   [119:37] Turn away my eyes from vain sights,
|    revive me by your word.
|   [119:38] Confirm to your servant the promise
|    which is given to those who fear you.
|   [119:39] Remove the reproach which I dread,
|    because your judgments are good.
|   [119:40] Behold, I long for your precepts.
|    Quicken me in your righteousness.
