##### Psalm 87 — Zion, City of God #####

Of the Korahites, a psalm. A song.

|   [87:1] On the holy mountain stands
|    the city he founded.
|   [87:2] The LORD loves the gates of Zion
|    more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
|   [87:3] Glorious things he is speaking of you,
|    you city of God. (Selah)

|   [87:4] ‘Among those who are mine I name Rahab and Babylon,
|    Philistia, Tyre, Ethiopia,
|    their people will say I was born in Zion.
|   [87:5] As for Zion it will be said
|    each and all were born in her.’
|  The LORD will preserve her.

|   [87:6] The LORD will count, when enrolling the peoples,
|    ‘This one was born there, and that one was born there.’ (Selah)
|   [87:7] Singers and dancers alike will say
|    ‘All my springs are in you.’

##### Psalm 89 — The Promise to David #####

A song. A psalm of the Korahites.

|   [89:1] I will sing evermore of the love of the LORD,
|    proclaiming to all generations his faithfulness.
|   [89:2] For your love you did promise to build up forever,
|    your faithfulness firm as the heavens themselves.

|   [89:3] ‘I have made with my chosen a covenant,
|    and sworn to David my servant,
|   [89:4] to establish his seed forever,
|    and to build up his throne to all ages.’ (Selah)

|   [89:5] Then the holy assembly in heaven
|    praised your marvellous faithfulness, LORD .
|   [89:6] For who in the skies may compare with the LORD ?
|    Who is like the LORD among the gods?

|   [89:7] A God to be feared in the holy assembly,
|    awful and great above all who are round him.
|   [89:8] O LORD God of hosts, who is mighty as you?
|    Your strength and faithfulness, LORD, surround you.

|   [89:9] You are the LORD of the raging sea:
|    when its waves surge, it is you who still them.
|   [89:10] It was you who did pierce and crush Rahab in pieces,
|    and scatter your foes by your mighty arm.

|   [89:11] Yours are the heavens, yours also the earth,
|    the world and its fulness, it’s you who did found them.
|   [89:12] The north and the south, it’s you have created them;
|    Tabor and Hermon shout praise to your name.

|   [89:13] You have an arm with the might of a hero;
|    strong is your hand, high uplifted your right hand.
|   [89:14] Justice and right are the base of your throne,
|    kindness and faithfulness ever attend you.

|   [89:15] Happy the people who know the glad shout,
|    who walk, O LORD, in the light of your face.
|   [89:16] They exult in your name all the day,
|    and your righteousness they extol.

|   [89:17] For you are our strength and our pride.
|    Your favour will lift us to honour.
|   [89:18] For the holy LORD of Israel
|    keeps our defender and king.

|   [89:19] In a vision of old you did speak
|    in this way to the one whom you loved,
|  ‘A crown I have set on the hero
|    I chose to be over the people

|   [89:20] I found my servant David,
|    and anointed with holy oil.
|   [89:21] My hand will be with him forever,
|    my arm will give him strength.

|   [89:22] No enemy will dare to assail him,
|    nor the wicked to oppress him;
|   [89:23] but his foes I will shatter before him,
|    I will strike down those who hate him.

|   [89:24] My loyal love shall attend him,
|    and I will lift him to honour.
|   [89:25] I will set his hand on the sea,
|    and his right hand on the rivers.

|   [89:26] As for him, he will call me “My father,
|    my God, and my rock of salvation.”
|   [89:27] And I will make him my first-born,
|    highest of kings on the earth.

|   [89:28] My love will I keep for him ever,
|    my covenant with him shall stand fast.
|   [89:29] His line will I make everlasting,
|    and his throne as the days of the heavens.

|   [89:30] If his children forsake my law,
|    and walk not as I have ordained;
|   [89:31] if they profane my statutes,
|    and do not keep my commandments;

|   [89:32] I will punish their sin with the rod,
|    their iniquity with scourges.
|   [89:33] But my love will I not take from him,
|    nor will I belie my faithfulness.

|   [89:34] I will not profane my covenant
|    by changing the word that has passed my lips.
|   [89:35] Once have I solemnly sworn
|    and I would not lie to David,

|   [89:36] that his line should endure forever,
|    and his throne as the sun before me,
|   [89:37] firm as the moon which for ever
|    and ever is fixed in the sky.’ (Selah)

|   [89:38] But you have cast off in contempt,
|    and been furious with your anointed.
|   [89:39] You have spurned the covenant with your servant,
|    and his sacred crown dashed to the ground.

|   [89:40] You have broken down all his walls,
|    and laid his bulwarks in ruins.
|   [89:41] All who pass on their way despoil him,
|    the scorn of his neighbours is he now.

|   [89:42] You have given his foes the victory,
|    and made all his enemies glad.
|   [89:43] You have turned back his sword from the foe,
|    you did not lift him up in the battle.

|   [89:44] The sceptre you took from his hand,
|    and his throne you did hurl to the ground.
|   [89:45] You have shortened the days of his youth,
|    and covered him with shame. (Selah)

|   [89:46] How long, LORD will you hide you forever?
|    How long are the fires of your wrath to burn?
|   [89:47] Remember, LORD, the shortness of life
|    how fleeting you made all people.

|   [89:48] Who can live without seeing death?
|    Who can rescue their life from the clutch of Sheol? (Selah)
|   [89:49] Where, LORD, is your kindness of old,
|    which you in your faithfulness swore to David?

|   [89:50] Remember, O LORD, how your servants are mocked,
|    how I bear in my heart the scorn of all nations
|   [89:51] The scorn which your enemies hurl, O LORD,
|    which they hurl at the footsteps of your anointed.



|       [89:52] Blest be the LORD, for ever and ever.
|      Amen and Amen.
