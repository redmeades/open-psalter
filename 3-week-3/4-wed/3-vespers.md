##### Psalm 103 — Bless the Lord, O my Soul #####

Of David.

|   [103:1] O my soul, bless the LORD ;
|    and all that is in me, his holy name.
|   [103:2] O my soul, bless the LORD ;
|    and forget not one of his benefits.
|   [103:3] He pardons all your sins,
|    he heals all your diseases.
|   [103:4] He ransoms your life from the pit,
|    he crowns you with kindness and pity.
|   [103:5] He gives you your heart’s desire,
|    renewing your youth like the eagle’s.

|   [103:6] The LORD executes justice -
|    and right for all who are wronged.
|   [103:7] He revealed his ways to Moses,
|    his acts to the children of Israel.
|   [103:8] Full of pity and grace is the LORD,
|    patient, and rich in kindness:
|   [103:9] he will not always chide,
|    nor cherish his anger forever.
|   [103:10] Not after our sins has he dealt with us,
|    nor requited us after our wickedness.

|   [103:11] For high as the heavens o”er the earth
|    is his love over those who fear him.
|   [103:12] Far as is east from the west
|    has he put our transgressions from us.
|   [103:13] As a father pities his children,
|    so the LORD pities those who fear him;
|   [103:14] for well he knows our frame,
|    he remembers that we are dust.

|   [103:15] A person’s days are as grass;
|    blossoms like a flower of the meadow.
|   [103:16] At the breath of the wind it is gone,
|    and the place thereof knows it no more.
|   [103:17] But the love of the LORD is eternal,
|    and his kindness to children’s children,
|   [103:18] to those who keep his covenant
|    and mindfully do his behests.

|   [103:19] The LORD has set his throne in the heavens;
|    the whole world is under his sway.
|   [103:20] Bless the LORD, you angels of his,
|    mighty heroes performing his word.
|   [103:21] Bless the LORD, all you his hosts,
|    you servants who do his will.
|   [103:22] Bless the LORD, all you his works,
|    far as his sway extends.
|    O my soul, bless the LORD .

##### Psalm 109 — A Prayer for the Lord’s Help #####

For the leader. Of David, a psalm.

|   [109:1] O God whom I praise, keep not silence;
|     [109:2] for their wicked mouths they have opened against me,
|    they speak to me with tongues that are false,
|   [109:3] they beset me with words of hatred,
|    and fight without cause against me.
|   [109:4] My love they requite with hostility,
|    while for them I lift up my prayer.
|   [109:5] Evil for good they reward me,
|    and hatred for my love.

|   [109:6] ‘Set over him one who is godless,’ they say,
|    ‘an opponent at his right hand.
|   [109:7] From his trial let him come forth guilty,
|    may his prayer be counted as sin.
|   [109:8] Grant that his days may be few,
|    that his office be seized by another.
|   [109:9] Grant that his children be fatherless,
|    and that his wife be a widow.
|   [109:10] Up and down may his children go begging,
|    expelled from their desolate home.
|   [109:11] May all that he owns be seized by the creditor
|    may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil.

|   [109:12] May none extend to him kindness,
|    or pity his fatherless children.
|   [109:13] His descendants be doomed to destruction!
|    Blotted out be his name in one generation!
|   [109:14] May his father’s guilt be remembered,
|    and his mother’s sin not blotted out:
|   [109:15] on record always before the LORD,
|    and his memory root from the earth;
|   [109:16] for he gave no thought to show kindness,
|    but pursued the poor and the needy,
|    drove the downhearted to death.

|   [109:17] May the curses he loved light upon him,
|    may the blessings he loathed be afar.
|   [109:18] Like a garment he clothed him with curses;
|    may they pierce to his inwards like water,
|    and cling to his bones like oil.
|   [109:19] Let them be like the robe he wraps round him,
|    like the belt he wears every day.’
|   [109:20] Be this the reward of my adversaries,
|    of those who speak evil against me.

|   [109:21] But you, LORD my GOD ,
|    be true to your name,
|      deal kindly with me;
|    in your gracious kindness
|      save me.
|   [109:22] For I am poor and needy,
|    and my heart is wounded within me.
|   [109:23] I am gone like a lengthening shadow,
|    I am shaken off like a locust.
|   [109:24] My knees totter from fasting,
|    my flesh is shrivelled and spare.
|   [109:25] They heap insults upon me:
|    when they see me, they shake their head.

|   [109:26] Help me, O LORD my God,
|    and save me in your kindness.
|   [109:27] Teach them that this is your hand,
|    and your own doing, O LORD .
|   [109:28] Let them curse, if only you bless.
|    Put my assailants to shame,
|    and make your servant glad.
|   [109:29] My opponents be clothed with dishonour,
|    and wrapped in a robe of shame.

|   [109:30] I give thanks to you, LORD, with loud voice,
|    I give praise in the midst of the throng;
|   [109:31] for he stands by the poor, at his right hand,
|    to save them from those who condemn them.
