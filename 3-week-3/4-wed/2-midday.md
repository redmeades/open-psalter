###Psalm 119:105-136

##### Psalm 119.73-104 — The Power and Comfort of the Word of God #####

|   [119:73] Your hands have made me and fashioned me;
|    make me wise to learn your commandments.
|   [119:74] Those who fear you shall see me with joy,
|    for in your word have I hoped.
|   [119:75] I know, O LORD, that your judgments are right,
|    and in faithfulness you have afflicted me.
|   [119:76] Let your love be a comfort to me,
|    for so have you promised your servant.
|   [119:77] Visit me with your quickening pity,
|    for your law is my delight.
|   [119:78] Put the proud to shame, who have wronged me falsely:
|    I will muse on your precepts.
|   [119:79] Let those turn to me who fear you,
|    that they may learn your charges.
|   [119:80] Let my heart be sound in your statutes,
|    that I may not be put to shame.

|   [119:81] My long for you to rescue me,
|    I put my hope in your word.
|   [119:82] My eyes pine away for your promise:
|    saying, ‘When will you comfort me?’
|   [119:83] Though shrivelled like wine-skin in smoke,
|    your statutes I have not forgotten.
|   [119:84] How few are the days of your servant!
|    When will you judge those who harass me?
|   [119:85] Proud people have dug for me pits
|    people who do not conform to your law.
|   [119:86] All your commandments are trusty.
|    With falsehood they harass me: help me.
|   [119:87] They had nearly made an end of me,
|    yet I did not forget your precepts.
|   [119:88] Spare me in your kindness,
|    and I will observe the charge of your mouth.

|   [119:89] Forever, O LORD, is your word
|    fixed firmly in the heavens.
|   [119:90] Your truth endures age after age;
|    it is established on earth, and it stands.
|   [119:91] By your appointment they stand this day,
|    for all are your servants.
|   [119:92] Had not your law been my joy,
|    in my misery then had I perished.
|   [119:93] I will never forget your precepts,
|    for through them you have put life in me.
|   [119:94] I am yours, O save me,
|    for I give my mind to your precepts.
|   [119:95] The wicked lay wait to destroy me,
|    but I give heed to your charge.
|   [119:96] I have seen a limit to all things:
|    but your commandment is spacious exceedingly.

|   [119:97] O how I love your law!
|    All the day long I muse on it.
|   [119:98] Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies:
|    for it is mine forever.
|   [119:99] I am prudent above all my teachers,
|    for your charges are my meditation.
|   [119:100] I have insight more than the aged,
|    because I observe your precepts.
|   [119:101] I refrain my foot from all wicked ways,
|    that I may keep your word.
|   [119:102] I turn not aside from your judgments,
|    for you yourself are my teacher.
|   [119:103] How sweet are your words to my taste,
|    sweeter than honey to my mouth!
|   [119:104] Insight I win through your precepts,
|    therefore every false way I hate.
