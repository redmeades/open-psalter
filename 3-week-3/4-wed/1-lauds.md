##### Psalm 67 — A Harvest Thanksgiving #####

For the leader. On stringed instruments. A psalm. A song.

|   [67:1] Bless us, O God, with your favour,
|    let the light of your face fall upon us; (Selah)
|   [67:2] that the world may know your way,
|    and all nations your power to save.

|   [67:3] Let the peoples praise you, O God;
|    let the peoples all of them praise you.
|   [67:4] Let the nations ring out their joy;
|    for you govern the peoples with equity,
|    and guide the nations on earth. (Selah)
|   [67:5] Let the peoples praise you, O God,
|    let the peoples, all of them, praise you.

|   [67:6] The earth has yielded her increase
|    by the blessing of God, our God.
|   [67:7] May this blessing of ours win people to him
|    to all the ends of the earth.

##### Psalm 72 — A Prayer for a Just and Glorious Reign #####

Of Solomon.

|   [72:1] Give the king, O God, your own spirit of justice
|    your spirit of right to the son of the king,
|   [72:2] that with right he may judge your people,
|    and your downtrodden ones with justice.

|   [72:3] May the mountains bear weal for the people,
|    and the hills yield fruits of justice.
|   [72:4] The weak may he help to their rights,
|    may he save the sons of the needy
|    and crush the oppressor in pieces.

|   [72:5] May he live as long as the sun,
|    while the moon shines — for ages and ages.
|   [72:6] May he be like the rain on the meadow,
|    like showers that water the earth.

|   [72:7] In his days may justice flourish,
|    and welfare abound, till the moon be no more.
|   [72:8] May he reign from ocean to ocean,
|    from the river to the ends of the earth.

|   [72:9] May his foes bow down before him,
|    his enemies lick the dust.
|   [72:10] May tribute be rendered by kings
|    of the isles and of Tarshish;
|  may gifts be brought by the kings
|    of Sheba and Seba.

|   [72:11] May all kings fall prostrate before him,
|    and all nations yield him their service.
|   [72:12] For he saves the poor when he cries,
|    the helpless and the downtrodden.

|   [72:13] He pities the weak and the poor,
|    he saves the lives of the poor.
|   [72:14] He redeems them from wrong and from violence,
|    for dear is their blood in his sight.

|   [72:15] Long may he live;
|    and may gold of Sheba be given him;
|  prayer, too, be made for him ceaselessly,
|    all the day long may men bless him.

|   [72:16] May the land have abundance of corn,
|    to the tops of the hills may it wave.
|  May the fruit thereof flourish like Lebanon,
|    may men spring from the city like grass of the earth.

|   [72:17] May his name be blessed forever,
|    may his fame endure as the sun.
|  May all nations envy his blessedness,
|    all tribes of the earth call him happy.



|       [72:18] Blest be the LORD God, Israel’s God,
|      who alone does wonders;
|       [72:19] And blest be forever his glorious name.
|      Let all the earth be filled with his glory.
|      Amen and Amen.

|       [72:20] Here end the prayers of David, son of Jesse.

##### Psalm 81 — For the Feast of Tabernacles #####

For the leader. On the gittith. Of Asaph.

|   [81:1] Sing aloud to God our strength,
|    shout for joy to the God of Jacob.
|   [81:2] Raise a song, sound the timbrel,
|    sweet lyre and harp.
|   [81:3] On the new moon blow the horn,
|    at the full moon, the day of our festival.
|   [81:4] For this is a statute for Israel,
|    a ruling of the God of Jacob,
|   [81:5] a witness he set up in Joseph,
|    when he marched against Egypt’s land,
|    where he heard an unknown language.

|   [81:6] ‘I removed from your shoulder the burden,
|    and freed your hands from the basket.
|   [81:7] At your call of distress I delivered you,
|    from the thundercloud I answered you.
|    At Meribah’s waters I tested you. (Selah)

|   [81:8] Listen, my people, to my warning,
|    O Israel, if you would but listen
|   [81:9] “There must not be a strange god among you,
|    you must bow to no foreign god.
|   [81:10] I am the LORD your God
|    who brought you up out of Egypt.
|    Open your mouth, that I fill it.”

|   [81:11] But my people did not listen to my voice,
|    Israel would have none of me.
|   [81:12] So to their own hard hearts I left them,
|    to follow their own devices.
|   [81:13] O that my people would listen,
|    that Israel would walk in my ways.
|   [81:14] Soon would I humble their enemies,
|    and turn my hand on their foes.
|   [81:15] Those who hate the LORD would cringe before him
|    in everlasting terror.
|   [81:16] But you would I feed with the richest wheat,
|    and with honey from the rock to your heart’s desire.’

##### Psalm 147.12-20 — The Lord’s Love and Power Revealed in Nature #####

|   [147:12] Praise the LORD, then, O Jerusalem:
|    sing praise to your God, O Zion.
|   [147:13] For he strengthens the bars of your gates,
|    and blesses your children within you.
|   [147:14] He brings peace to your borders,
|    and choicest of wheat in abundance.
|   [147:15] He sends his command to the earth:
|    his word runs very swiftly.
|   [147:16] Snow he gives like wool,
|    frost he scatters like ashes.
|   [147:17] He casts forth his ice like morsels:
|    who can stand before his cold?
|   [147:18] He sends forth his word, and melts them:
|    his wind blows the waters flow.

|   [147:19] He declares his word to Jacob,
|    his statutes and judgments to Israel.
|   [147:20] No other nation did he do this for,
|    they know nothing of his judgments.
|      Hallelujah.
