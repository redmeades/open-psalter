##### Psalm 29 — The Lord’s Glory in the Storm #####

A psalm of David.

|   [29:1] Ascribe to the LORD, you heavenly beings,
|    ascribe to the LORD glory and power
|   [29:2] Ascribe to the LORD the glory he manifests:
|    bow to the LORD in holy array.

|   [29:3] The LORD’s voice peals on the waters.
|    The God of glory has thundered.
|    He peals o”er the mighty waters.
|   [29:4] The LORD’s voice sounds with strength,
|    the LORD’s voice sounds with majesty.

|   [29:5] The LORD’s voice breaks the cedars,
|    he breaks the cedars of Lebanon,
|   [29:6] making Lebanon dance like a calf,
|    Sirion like a young wild ox.

|   [29:7] The LORD’s voice hews out flames of fire.
|   [29:8] The LORD’s voice rends the desert,
|    he rends the desert of Kadesh.

|   [29:9] The LORD’s voice whirls the oaks,
|    and strips the forests bare;
|    and all in his temple say ‘Glory.’

|   [29:10] The LORD was king at the flood,
|    the LORD sits throned forever.
|   [29:11] The LORD gives strength to his people,
|    he blesses his people with peace.

##### Psalm 66 — Thanksgiving for National Deliverance #####

For the leader. A song. A psalm.

|   [66:1] Shout to God, all the earth,
|     [66:2] sing praise to his glorious name,
|    sing his glorious praise.
|   [66:3] Say to God, ‘How dread are your works,
|    so great is your might that your enemies cringe to you.
|   [66:4] All the earth does homage to you,
|    singing praises to you,
|    singing praise to your name.’ (Selah)

|   [66:5] Come and see what God has done,
|    awe-inspiring is he in his works among people.
|   [66:6] He turns the sea into dry land,
|    and people cross the river on foot.
|  Let us therefore rejoice in him,
|     [66:7] the mighty Ruler eternal,
|  whose eyes keep watch on the nations,
|    that no rebel lift up his head. (Selah)

|   [66:8] O bless our God, you peoples;
|    sound aloud his praise,
|   [66:9] who keeps us in life,
|    and keeps our feet from slipping.
|   [66:10] For you, God, have tested us,
|    have tried us, as silver is tried.
|   [66:11] You did bring us into prison,
|    and put chains upon us,
|   [66:12] you did let people ride over our head.
|    We went through fire and through water,
|    but you led us out to a spacious place.

|   [66:13] I will enter your house with burnt-offerings,
|    I will pay to you my vows,
|   [66:14] which my open lips have uttered,
|    arid my mouth has declared in my straits.
|   [66:15] I will offer you offerings of fatlings,
|    with the odour of burning rams,
|    I will sacrifice bullocks with goats. (Selah)

|   [66:16] Come and hear my story
|    all who fear God —
|    of what he has done for me.
|   [66:17] For my mouth had no sooner invoked him
|    than his praise was under my tongue.
|   [66:18] Had I cherished sin in my heart,
|    the LORD would never have listened.
|   [66:19] But assuredly God has listened,
|    and attended to my loud prayer.

|   [66:20] Blessed be God, who turned not aside
|    my prayer, nor withdrew his kindness from me.

##### Psalm 76 — A Song of Victory #####

For the leader. With instrumental music. A psalm of Asaph, a song.

|   [76:1] God has made himself known in Judah,
|    his name is great in Israel.
|   [76:2] His tent is in Salem,
|    his dwelling in Zion.

|   [76:3] There he broke the lightning arrows,
|    shield, sword, and weapons of war. (Selah)
|   [76:4] Terrible is your splendour
|    on the everlasting mountains.

|   [76:5] Despoiled were the stout of heart;
|    in the sleep into which they had fallen,
|  none of the warriors
|    could lift a hand.

|   [76:6] At your rebuke, God of Jacob,
|    sank chariot and horse to sleep.
|   [76:7] Awful are you: who can stand
|    before you, when once you are angry?

|   [76:8] The judgment you gave from heaven
|    frightened the earth into silence,
|   [76:9] when God arose to judgment
|    to save the oppressed of the earth. (Selah)

|   [76:10] The fiercest will praise you,
|    to you will the remnant hold festival.
|   [76:11] Vow and pay to LORD your God,
|    and let all who are round him bring presents.

|   [76:12] He lops off the courage of princes,
|    and with terror fills kings of the earth.

##### Psalm 147.1-11 — The Lord’s Love and Power Revealed in Nature #####

|       [147:1] Hallelujah.

|  It is good to sing praise to our God,
|    for praise is sweet and seemly.
|   [147:2] The LORD builds up Jerusalem,
|    the outcasts of Israel he gathers.
|   [147:3] He heals the broken in heart,
|    and binds up their wounds.
|   [147:4] He counts the numberless stars,
|    he gives names to them all.
|   [147:5] Great is our LORD, rich in power,
|    and measureless is his wisdom.
|   [147:6] The LORD lifts up the down-trodden,
|    the wicked he brings to the ground.

|   [147:7] Sing songs of thanks to the LORD,
|    and play on the lyre to our God.
|   [147:8] For he covers the sky with clouds,
|    he prepares rain for the earth,
|    makes grass to grow on the mountains.
|   [147:9] He gives the cattle their food
|    the young ravens when they cry.
|   [147:10] His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse,
|    his joy is not in the speed of a runner;
|   [147:11] but the LORD has his pleasure in those who fear him,
|    in those who wait for his kindness.
