##### Psalm 77 — A Prayer for Preservation as in the Days of Old #####

For the leader. On Jeduthun. Of Asaph, a psalm.

|   [77:1] Loudly will I lift my cry to God,
|    loudly to God, so he hears to me.
|   [77:2] In the day of my trouble I seek the LORD ;
|    in the night I lift my hands in prayer,
|    refusing all comfort.

|   [77:3] When I think of God, I moan;
|    when I muse, my spirit is faint. (Selah)
|   [77:4] When you hold my eyes awake,
|    and I am restless and speechless,
|   [77:5] I think of the days of old,
|    call to mind distant years.
|   [77:6] I commune with my heart in the night,
|    I muse with inquiring spirit.
|   [77:7] ‘Will the LORD cast us off forever,
|    will he be gracious no more?
|   [77:8] Has his love vanished forever?
|    Is his faithfulness utterly gone?
|   [77:9] Has God forgotten to be gracious,
|    or in anger withheld his compassion?’ (Selah)

|   [77:10] Then I said, ‘This it is that grieves me,
|    that the hand of the Most High has changed.”
|   [77:11] I will think of the deeds of the LORD,
|    and remember your wonders of old.
|   [77:12] I will muse on all you have wrought,
|    and meditate on your deeds.
|   [77:13] Then your way, O God, was majestic:
|    what God was great as our God?
|   [77:14] You were a God who did marvels,
|    you did show your power to the world
|   [77:15] by your arm you rescued your people,
|    the children of Jacob and Joseph. (Selah)

|   [77:16] The waters saw you, O God.
|    The waters saw you and shivered;
|    to their depths they trembled.
|   [77:17] Clouds poured torrents of water,
|    thunder rolled in the sky,
|    your arrows sped to and fro.
|   [77:18] Loud was the roll of your thunder,
|    lightnings lit up the world.
|    Earth quaked and trembled.
|   [77:19] In your way, LORD, through the sea,
|    in your path through the mighty waters,
|    your footsteps were all unseen.
|   [77:20] You did guide your folk like a flock
|    by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

##### Psalm 102 — A Prayer for Pity and for the Restoration of Zion #####

|   [102:1] Hear my prayer, O LORD ;
|    let my cry for help come to you.
|   [102:2] Hide not your face from me
|    in the day of my distress.
|  Incline your ear to me:
|    when I call, answer me speedily.

|   [102:3] For my days pass away like smoke:
|    my bones are burned through as with fire.
|   [102:4] My heart is scorched, withered like grass;
|    I forget to eat my bread.
|   [102:5] By reason of my loud groaning,
|    my flesh clings to my bones.

|   [102:6] Like a desert-owl of the wilderness,
|    like an owl among ruins am I.
|   [102:7] I make my sleepless lament
|    like a bird on the house-top alone.
|   [102:8] All the day wild foes revile me,
|    using my name for a curse.

|   [102:9] For ashes have been my bread,
|    and tears have been mixed with my cup.
|   [102:10] Because of your passionate anger,
|    you did raise me, then hurl me to the ground.
|   [102:11] My days come to an end, shadows lengthen,
|    I wither like grass.

|   [102:12] But you, O LORD, are enthroned forever,
|    your fame endures to all generations.
|   [102:13] You will arise and have pity on Zion;
|    it’s time to be gracious; her hour has come.
|   [102:14] For even her stones are dear to your servants,
|    even the dust of her ruins they look on with love.

|   [102:15] Then the nations will revere the name of the LORD
|     and all the kings of the earth his glory,
|   [102:16] when the LORD shall have built up Zion,
|    and revealed himself in his glory,
|   [102:17] in response to the prayer of the destitute,
|    whose prayer he will not despise.

|   [102:18] Let this be recorded for ages to come,
|    that the LORD may be praised by a people yet unborn.
|   [102:19] For he shall look down from his holy height,
|    from the heavens the LORD will gaze on the earth,
|   [102:20] to hear the groans of the prisoner,
|    to free those who are doomed to die;
|   [102:21] that people may recount the LORD’s fame in Zion,
|    and the praise of him in Jerusalem,
|   [102:22] when the nations are gathered together,
|    and the kingdoms, to worship the LORD .

|   [102:23] He has broken my strength on the way,
|    he has shortened my days.
|   [102:24] I will say, ‘My God, take me not hence
|    in the midst of my days.

|  Your years endure age after age.
|     [102:25] Of old you have founded the earth,
|    and the heavens are the work of your hands.
|   [102:26] They shall perish; but you do stand.
|    They shall all wax old like a garment,
|    and change as a robe you will change them.
|   [102:27] But you are the same, your years are endless.
|     [102:28] The children of your servants abide,
|    evermore shall their seed be before you.’
