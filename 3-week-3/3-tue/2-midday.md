##### Psalm 119.41-72 â€” The Power and Comfort of the Word of God #####

|   [119:41] Visit me, LORD, with your love
|    and salvation, as you have promised.
|   [119:42] So shall I answer my slanderers,
|    for my trust is in your word.
|   [119:43] Snatch not from my mouth the word of truth,
|    for in your judgments I hope.
|   [119:44] I will keep your law continually,
|    for ever and evermore.
|   [119:45] So shall I walk in wide spaces,
|    for I give my mind to your precepts.
|   [119:46] I will speak of your charge before kings,
|    and will not be ashamed thereof.
|   [119:47] Your commandments are my delight,
|    I love them exceedingly.
|   [119:48] I will lift up my hands to your commandments,
|    and muse upon your statutes.

|   [119:49] Remember your word to your servant,
|    on which you have made me to hope.
|   [119:50] This is my comfort in trouble,
|    that your word gives life to me.
|   [119:51] The arrogant utterly scorn me,
|    but I have not declined from your law.
|   [119:52] When I think of your judgments of old,
|    O LORD, I take to me comfort.
|   [119:53] I am seized with glowing anger
|    at the wicked who forsake your law.
|   [119:54] Your statutes have been to me songs
|    in the house of my pilgrimage.
|   [119:55] I remember your name in the night,
|    O LORD and observe your law.
|   [119:56] My lot has been this,
|    that I have kept your precepts.

|   [119:57] My portion are you, O LORD :
|    I have promised to keep your words.
|   [119:58] I entreat you with all my heart;
|    grant me your promised favour.
|   [119:59] I have thought upon my ways,
|    and turned my feet to your charges.
|   [119:60] I hasted and tarried not
|    to give heed to your commandments.
|   [119:61] Though the godless have wound their cords round me,
|    I have not forgotten your law.
|   [119:62] At midnight I rise to praise you
|    because of your righteous judgments.
|   [119:63] With all those who fear you I company,
|    aid with those who observe your precepts.
|   [119:64] The earth, LORD, is full of your kindness;
|    teach me your Statutes.

|   [119:65] Well have you dealt with your servant,
|    as you have promised, O LORD .
|   [119:66] Teach me discretion and knowledge,
|    for I have believed your commandments.
|   [119:67] Till trouble came I was a wanderer,
|    but now I observe your word.
|   [119:68] You are good and do good;
|    teach me your statutes.
|   [119:69] The proud have forged lies against me,
|    but I keep your precepts with all my heart.
|   [119:70] Their heart is gross like fat,
|    but I delight in your law.
|   [119:71] It was good for me to be humbled,
|    that I should learn your statutes.
|   [119:72] The law of your mouth is better to me
|    than thousands of pieces of silver and gold.
