##### Psalm 106 — The Nation’s Sin against the Lord #####

|       [106:1] Hallelujah!

|  Give thanks to the LORD for his goodness,
|    for his kindness endures forever.
|   [106:2] Who can describe his heroic deeds,
|    or publish all his praise?
|   [106:3] Happy they who act justly,
|    and do righteousness evermore.

|   [106:4] Remember me, LORD, as you remember your people,
|    and visit me with your gracious help.
|   [106:5] May I see the good fortune of your elect,
|    may I share in the joy of your nation,
|    and in the pride of your heritage.

|   [106:6] We, like our fathers, have sinned,
|    we have done perversely and wickedly
|   [106:7] In the land of Egypt our fathers,
|    all heedless of your wonders,
|  and unmindful of your great kindness,
|    at the Red Sea defied the Most High.
|   [106:8] But true to his name he saved them,
|    in order to show his might.
|   [106:9] He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried;
|    they marched through the depths as through desert,
|   [106:10] saved from the hand of the hostile,
|    redeemed from the hand of the foe.
|   [106:11] The waters covered their enemies:
|    not one of them was left.
|   [106:12] So then they believed in his words,
|    and began to sing his praise.

|   [106:13] But soon they forgot his deeds:
|    they did not wait for his counsel.
|   [106:14] Their greed was ravenous in the desert;
|    they put God to the test in the wilderness.
|   [106:15] He gave them the thing they had asked for,
|    but sent wasting disease among them.

|   [106:16] The camp grew jealous of Moses
|    and of Aaron, holy one of the LORD .
|   [106:17] The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
|    and covered Abiram’s company.
|   [106:18] Fire broke out on their company,
|    flame kindled upon the wicked.

|   [106:19] They made a calf in Horeb,
|    and bowed to the molten image.
|   [106:20] They exchanged their glorious God
|    for the image of ox that eats grass.
|   [106:21] They forgot the God who had saved them
|    by mighty deeds in Egypt
|   [106:22] Wonders in the land of Ham,
|    terrors by the Red Sea.
|   [106:23] So he vowed, and would have destroyed them,
|    but for Moses his elect,
|  who stepped into the breach before him,
|    to divert his deadly wrath.

|   [106:24] They spurned the delightsome land,
|    they refused to believe in his word.
|   [106:25] They grumbled in their tents,
|    would not listen to the voice of the LORD .
|   [106:26] So he swore with uplifted hand
|    to lay them low in the wilderness;
|   [106:27] to disperse their seed among heathen,
|    to scatter them over the world.

|   [106:28] Then they joined them to Baal of Peor,
|    and ate what was offered the dead.
|   [106:29] They provoked him to wrath by their deeds,
|    and plague broke out among them.
|   [106:30] Then Phinehas stood between,
|    and so the plague was stayed;
|   [106:31] and it was counted to him for righteousness
|    unto all generations forever.

|   [106:32] They angered him at the waters of Meribah,
|    through them it went ill with Moses.
|   [106:33] They rebelled against his spirit,
|    and he uttered speech that was rash.

|   [106:34] They did not destroy the nations,
|  as the LORD had commanded them;
|     [106:35] but they mingled with the heathen,
|  and learned to do as they did.
|     [106:36] Their idol gods they worshipped,
|  and they were ensnared by them.
|     [106:37] They sacrificed their sons
|  and their daughters to the demons.
|     [106:38] They poured out innocent blood
|  the blood of their sons and daughters
|    whom they offered to Canaan’s idols,
|  and the land was polluted with blood.
|     [106:39] They became unclean by their works,
|  and adulterous in their deeds.
|     [106:40] Then the LORD’s fury was on his people,
|  filled with horror at his inheritance.
|     [106:41] He delivered them to the heathen,
|  to the sway of those who hated them.
|     [106:42] Their enemies oppressed them,
|  and subdued them under their hand.
|     [106:43] Many a time he saved them,
|  but they rebelled at his counsel,
|    and were brought low by their wrongdoing.
|   [106:44] Yet he looked upon their distress,
|    when he heard their cry.
|   [106:45] He remembered his covenant,
|    and, in his great kindness, relented.
|   [106:46] He caused them to be pitied
|    by all who carried them captive.

|   [106:47] Save us, O LORD our God,
|    and gather us out of the nations,
|  to give thanks to your holy name,
|    and to make our boast of your praise.



|       [106:48] Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
|      from everlasting to everlasting.
|      And let all the people say ‘Amen.’
|      Praise the LORD .
