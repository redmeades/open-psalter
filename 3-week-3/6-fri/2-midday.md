##### Psalm 119.137-176 — The Power and Comfort of the Word of God #####

|   [119:137] Righteous are you, O LORD,
|    and right are your ordinances.
|   [119:138] The laws you has ordered are just,
|    and trusty exceedingly.
|   [119:139] My jealousy has undone me,
|    that my foes have forgotten your words.
|   [119:140] Your word has been tested well;
|    and your servant loves it.
|   [119:141] I am little and held in contempt,
|    but your precepts I have not forgotten.
|   [119:142] Just is your justice forever,
|    and trusty is your law.
|   [119:143] Stress and strain are upon me,
|    but your commandments are my delight.
|   [119:144] Right are your charges forever,
|    instruct me that I may live.

|   [119:145] With my whole heart I cry; O answer me.
|    I would keep your statutes, O LORD .
|   [119:146] I cry to you: O save me,
|    and I will observe your charges.
|   [119:147] Ere the dawn I cry for your help:
|    in your word do I hope.
|   [119:148] Awake I meet the night-watches,
|    to muse upon your sayings.
|   [119:149] Hear my voice in your kindness:
|    O LORD, by your judgments revive me.
|   [119:150] Near me are wicked tormentors,
|    who are far from thoughts of your law;
|   [119:151] but near, too, are you, O LORD,
|    and all your commandments are trusty.
|   [119:152] Long have I known from your charges
|    that you have founded them for all time.

|   [119:153] Look on my misery, and rescue me;
|    for I do not forget your law.
|   [119:154] Defend my cause and redeem me:
|    revive me, as you have promised.
|   [119:155] Salvation is far from the wicked,
|    for their mind is not in your statutes.
|   [119:156] Great is your pity, O LORD :”
|    Revive me, as you have ordained.
|   [119:157] My foes and tormentors are many,
|    but I have not declined from your charges.
|   [119:158] I behold the traitors with loathing,
|    for they do not observe your word.
|   [119:159] Behold how I love your precepts:
|    revive me, O LORD !, in your kindness.
|   [119:160] The sum of your word is truth,
|    all your laws are just and eternal.

|   [119:161] Princes have harassed me wantonly:
|    but my heart stands in awe of your word.
|   [119:162] Over your word I rejoice
|    as one who finds great spoil.
|   [119:163] Falsehood I hate and abhor,
|    but your law do I love.
|   [119:164] Seven times a day do I praise you
|    because of your righteous judgments.
|   [119:165] Right well do they fare who love your law:
|    they go on their way without stumbling.
|   [119:166] I hope for your salvation;
|    O LORD I do your commandments.
|   [119:167] I observe your charges:
|    I love them greatly.
|   [119:168] I observe your precepts and charges:
|    all my ways are before you.

|   [119:169] Let my cry come before you, O LORD :
|    give me insight, as you have promised.
|   [119:170] Let my prayer enter into your presence:
|    deliver me, as you have said.
|   [119:171] My lips shall be fountains of praise,
|    that you teach me your statutes.
|   [119:172] My tongue shall sing of your word,
|    for all your commandments are right.
|   [119:173] Let your hand be ready to help me,
|    for your precepts have been my choice.
|   [119:174] I long, LORD, for your salvation,
|    and your law is my delight.
|   [119:175] Revive me that I may praise you,
|    and let your precepts help me.
|   [119:176] I have strayed like a wandering sheep
|    seek your servant, because
|    I do not forget your commandments.
