##### Psalm 122 — The Joy and the Prayer of the Pilgrims #####

A song of ascents. Of David.

|   [122:1] I was glad when they said to me,
|    ‘We will go to the house of the LORD .’
|   [122:2] Now we are standing,
|    within your gates, O Jerusalem.

|   [122:3] O Jerusalem, built close-packed,
|    like a city without breach or gap,
|   [122:4] to you do the tribes come,
|    the tribes of the LORD,
|  as the law has ordained for Israel,
|    there to give thanks to the LORD .
|   [122:5] There once stood thrones of justice
|    even thrones of the household of David.

|   [122:6] Pray that all may be well with Jerusalem,
|    and well with those who love you,
|   [122:7] well within your ramparts,
|    and well within your palaces.

|   [122:8] For the sake of my brethren and friends,
|    I will wish you now prosperity:
|   [122:9] for the sake of the house of the LORD
|     our God, I will seek your good.

##### Psalm 51 — God be Merciful to Me, the Sinner #####

For the leader. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet come to him after he had been with Bathsheba.

|   [51:1] In your kindness, O God, be gracious to me,
|    in your own great pity blot out my transgressions.
|   [51:2] Wash me clean of my guilt,
|    make me pure of my sin.

|   [51:3] For well I know my transgressions,
|    my sin is ever before me.
|   [51:4] Against you, only you, have I sinned,
|    and done that which is wrong in your sight:
|  you therefore are just when you speak,
|    and clear when you utter judgment.
|   [51:5] See! In guilt was I brought to the birth,
|    and in sin did my mother conceive me.
|   [51:6] It’s the innermost truth you desire,
|    give me therefore true wisdom of heart.

|   [51:7] Purge me clean with hyssop,
|    wash me whiter than snow.
|   [51:8] Fill me with joy and gladness,
|    let the bones you have broken rejoice.
|   [51:9] Hide your face from my sins,
|    and blot out my guilt altogether.

|   [51:10] Create me a clean heart, O God,
|    put a new steadfast spirit within me.
|   [51:11] Cast me not forth from your presence,
|    withdraw not your holy spirit.
|   [51:12] Give me back the joy of your help,
|    with a willing spirit sustain me.

|   [51:13] I will teach your ways to transgressors,
|    and sinners shall turn to you.
|   [51:14] Save me from blood, O God,
|    and my tongue shall ring out your faithfulness.
|   [51:15] Open my lips, O LORD,
|    and my mouth shall declare your praise.

|   [51:16] For in sacrifice you have no pleasure,
|    in gifts of burnt-offering no delight.
|   [51:17] The sacrifice pleasing to God
|    is a spirit that is broken;
|  a heart that is crushed, O God,
|    you will not despise.

|   [51:18] Do good in your pleasure to Zion,
|    build the walls of Jerusalem.
|   [51:19] Then will you welcome the due forms of sacrifice,
|    then on your altars shall bullocks be offered.

##### Psalm 85 — A Prayer for National Restoration #####

For the leader. Of the Korahites, a psalm.

|   [85:1] Once, LORD, you did favour your land,
|    granting change of fortune to Jacob,
|   [85:2] forgiving the guilt of your people,
|    pardoning all their sin, (Selah)
|   [85:3] withdrawing all your fury,
|    turning from your hot anger.

|   [85:4] Restore us, O God our saviour,
|    put away your displeasure against us.
|   [85:5] Will you cherish your anger against us forever,
|    prolonging your wrath to all generations?
|   [85:6] Will you not revive us again,
|    that your people may be glad in you?
|   [85:7] Show us your kindness, O LORD,
|    grant us your salvation.

|   [85:8] Let me hear what God the LORD will speak;
|    for he will speak of peace
|  to his people, to those who love him,
|    and turn their hearts to him.
|   [85:9] Soon those who fear him shall see how he saves,
|    and glory shall live in our land.

|   [85:10] Kindness and loyalty meet;
|    peace and righteousness kiss.
|   [85:11] Loyalty springs from the earth;
|    righteousness looks from the sky.
|   [85:12] The LORD shall give all that is good,
|    our land yielding its increase,
|   [85:13] righteousness marching before him,
|    and peace on the path he treads.

##### Psalm 149 — Song of Victory #####

|       [149:1] Hallelujah.

|  Sing to the LORD a new song,
|    sound his praise where the faithful are gathered.
|   [149:2] Let Israel rejoice in its maker,
|    sons of Zion exult in their king.
|   [149:3] Let them praise his name in the dance,
|    making music with lyre and with timbrel.
|   [149:4] For the LORD delights in his people,
|    adorning the humble with victory.

|   [149:5] Let the faithful exult and extol him
|    with glad ringing cries all night long.
|   [149:6] High praises of God in their mouth,
|    and a two-edged sword in their hand:
|   [149:7] on the heathen to execute vengeance,
|    and chastisement sore on the nations,
|   [149:8] binding their kings with chains,
|    and their nobles with fetters of iron,
|   [149:9] to execute on them the doom that is written.

|    This is the glory of all his faithful.
|      Hallelujah.
