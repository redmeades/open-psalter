##### Psalm 62 — Quietness and Confidence #####

For the leader. On jeduthun. A psalm of David.

|   [62:1] I wait alone in silence for God;
|    From him comes my help.
|   [62:2] Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat,
|    I shall not be shaken too sorely.
|   [62:3] How long will you, all of you, batter a man,
|    as one might a leaning wall?
|   [62:4] From his height
|    they are planning to topple him.
|  They take pleasure in falsehood; they bless with their mouth,
|    but inwardly they curse. (Selah)

|   [62:5] I wait alone in silence for God;
|    for from him comes my hope.
|   [62:6] Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat,
|    I shall not be shaken too sorely.
|   [62:7] On God rests my honour and safety,
|    in God is my strong rock, my refuge.
|   [62:8] Trust in him, all you people assembled,
|    pour out your heart in his presence;
|    God is a refuge for us. (Selah)

|   [62:9] The lowly are nought but a breath,
|    the lofty are but an illusion:
|  in the balances up they go,
|    they are lighter than breath altogether.
|   [62:10] Trust not in gain of extortion,
|    set no vain hopes in robbery.
|  As for wealth, if it bears fruit,
|    set not your heart upon it.

|   [62:11] One thing God has uttered,
|    two things there are which I heard
|  that power belongs to God,
|     [62:12] and to you, too, O LORD, belongs kindness;
|  for you requite each person
|    according to what they have done.

##### Psalm 78.36-72 — The Warnings of History #####

|   [78:36] But they flattered him with their mouth,
|    and lied to him with their tongue.
|   [78:37] Their heart was not steady with him,
|    they were faithless to his covenant.

|   [78:38] But he is full of pity:
|    he pardons sin and destroys not.
|  Often he turns his anger away,
|    without stirring his wrath at all.
|   [78:39] So he remembered that they were but flesh,
|    breath that passes and does not return.

|   [78:40] But how often they rebelled in the desert,
|    and caused him grief in the wilderness,
|   [78:41] tempting God again and again,
|    provoking the Holy One of Israel.
|   [78:42] They did not remember his strength,
|    nor the day he redeemed from the foe,
|   [78:43] how he set his signs in Egypt,
|    in the country of Zoan his wonders.

|   [78:44] He turned their canals into blood,
|    their streams undrinkable.
|   [78:45] He sent forth flies, which devoured them;
|    frogs, too, which destroyed them.
|   [78:46] Their crops he gave to the caterpillar,
|    and the fruits of their toil to the locust.
|   [78:47] He slew their vines with hail,
|    and their sycamore trees with frost.
|   [78:48] He delivered their cattle to the hail,
|    and their flocks to bolts of fire.

|   [78:49] He let loose his hot anger among them,
|    fury and wrath and distress,
|    a band of destroying angels.
|   [78:50] He cleared a path for his anger,
|    did not spare them from death,
|    but gave them over to pestilence.

|   [78:51] He struck down all the first-born in Egypt,
|    the first fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
|   [78:52] He led forth his people like sheep,
|    he was guide to his flock in the desert.
|   [78:53] Securely he led them, and free from fear,
|    while their foes were drowned in the sea.

|   [78:54] To his holy realm he brought them,
|    to the mountain his right hand had purchased.
|   [78:55] He drove out the nations before them,
|    and allotted their land for possession,
|    and their tents for Israel to live in.

|   [78:56] Yet they tempted and angered the Most High God,
|    they did not observe his decrees.
|   [78:57] They drew back, false like their ancestors;
|    they failed like a treacherous bow.
|   [78:58] Their shrines stirred him to anger,
|    their idols moved him to jealousy.

|   [78:59] When God heard of this, he was furious,
|    and he spurned Israel utterly.
|   [78:60] He abandoned his home in Shiloh,
|    the tent he had pitched among people.
|   [78:61] He gave his strength up to captivity,
|    his glory to the hands of the foe.

|   [78:62] He gave his people to the sword,
|    he was furious with his own.
|   [78:63] Fire devoured their young men,
|    and their maidens had no marriage-song.
|   [78:64] Their priests fell by the sword,
|    and their widows could not weep.

|   [78:65] Then the LORD awoke as from sleep,
|    like a warrior flushed with wine;
|   [78:66] and he beat back his foes,
|    putting them to perpetual scorn.
|   [78:67] He disowned the tent of Joseph,
|    he rejected the tribe of Ephraim;
|   [78:68] but he chose the tribe of Judah,
|    Mount Zion, which he loves.
|   [78:69] And he built like the heights his sanctuary,
|    like the earth which he founded forever.

|   [78:70] And he chose David his servant,
|    taking him from the sheepfolds.
|   [78:71] From the mother-ewes he brought him,
|    to be shepherd to Jacob his people,
|    and to Israel his inheritance.
|   [78:72] With upright heart did he shepherd them,
|    and with skilful hands did he guide them.
