##### Psalm 100 — A Call to Worship #####

A psalm of praise.

|   [100:1] Shout, all the earth, to the LORD .
|     [100:2] Serve the LORD with gladness,
|    approach him with ringing cries.
|   [100:3] Be sure that the LORD alone is God.
|    It is he who has made us, and his we are
|    his people, the sheep of his pasture.

|   [100:4] Enter his gates with thanksgiving,
|    his courts with praise.
|  Give thanks to him, bless his name.
|   [100:5] For the LORD is good, his love is forever,
|    and to all ages endures his faithfulness.

##### Psalm 50 — True Worship #####

A psalm of Asaph.

|   [50:1] The LORD God has spoken: He summons the earth
|    from sunrise to sunset.
|   [50:2] From Zion, perfection of beauty,
|    God’s glory shines forth.
|   [50:3] Our God comes, he cannot keep silence,
|  devouring fire is before him,
|    and furious tempest around him.
|   [50:4] He summons the heavens above
|    and the earth to judge his people.
|   [50:5] Gather to him his saints
|    by covenant-sacrifice bound to him;
|   [50:6] that the heavens may declare his justice,
|    for a God of justice is he. (Selah)

|   [50:7] ‘Hear, O my people, and I will speak,
|    and protest to you, O Israel:
|    I am the LORD, your God.
|   [50:8] Not for your sacrifices will I reprove you
|    your burnt-offerings are ever before me
|   [50:9] Not a bullock will I take from your house,
|    nor he-goats out of your folds;
|   [50:10] for all beasts of the forest are mine,
|    and the kine on a thousand hills.
|   [50:11] I know all the birds of the air,
|    all that moves on the fields is mine.
|   [50:12] Were I hungry, I would not tell you,
|    for the world and its fulness are mine.
|   [50:13] Am I such as to eat bulls” flesh,
|    or drink the blood of goats?
|   [50:14] Offer to God a thank-offering,
|    pay the Most High your vows.
|   [50:15] Summon me in the day of distress,
|    I will rescue you, so will you honour me.’

|   [50:16] But to the wicked God says:
|    ‘What right have you to talk of my statutes,
|    or take my covenant into your mouth
|   [50:17] While you yourself hate correction,
|    and cast my words behind you?
|   [50:18] When you see a thief, you run with them;
|    with adulterers you keep company.
|   [50:19] You let your mouth loose for evil,
|    your tongue contrives deceit.
|   [50:20] You shamefully speak of your kin,
|    and slander your own mother’s son.
|   [50:21] And because I kept silence at this,
|    you did take me for one like yourself.
|    But I will convict you and show you plainly.

|   [50:22] Now you who forget God, mark this,
|    lest I rend you, past hope of deliverance.
|   [50:23] Those who bring a thank-offering honour me;
|    but to those: who follows my way,
|    I will show the salvation of God.’

##### Psalm 64 — A Prayer for Deliverance from Malicious Foes #####

For the leader. A psalm of David.

|   [64:1] Hear, O my God, the voice of my lament:
|    guard my life from the foe who affrights me.
|   [64:2] Hide me from villains who secretly plot,
|    from the blustering throng of the workers of evil,
|   [64:3] who have sharpened their tongue like a sword,
|    and aimed bitter words like arrows,
|   [64:4] which from ambush they launch at the blameless,
|    shooting swiftly and unafraid.

|   [64:5] They strengthen their wicked purpose,
|    they tell of the snares they have hidden,
|    they say to themselves, ‘Who can see?’
|   [64:6] They think out their crimes full cunningly
|    hidden deep in their crafty hearts.

|   [64:7] But God with his arrow will shoot them,
|    swiftly shall they be smitten.
|   [64:8] For their tongue he will bring them to ruin,
|    all will shudder with horror at the sight of them.

|   [64:9] Then every person, touched to awe,
|    as they ponder what God has wrought,
|    will tell the tale of his deeds.
|   [64:10] In the LORD shall the righteous rejoice,
|    in him shall they take refuge;
|    and all the true-hearted shall glory.

##### Psalm 148 — The Universal Chorus of Praise #####

|   [148:1] Praise the LORD from the heavens,
|    praise him in the heights.
|   [148:2] Praise him, all his angels;
|    praise him, all his hosts.

|   [148:3] Praise him, sun and moon;
|    praise him, all stars of light.
|   [148:4] Praise him, you highest heavens,
|    and you waters above the heavens.

|   [148:5] Let them praise the name of the LORD,
|    for at his command they were made.
|   [148:6] And he fixed them for ever and ever
|    by a law which they dare not transgress.

|   [148:7] Praise the LORD from the earth:
|    you depths, with your monsters, all.
|   [148:8] Fire, hail, snow and ice,
|    and stormy wind doing his word.

|   [148:9] All you mountains and hills,
|    all you fruit trees and cedars,
|   [148:10] all you wild beasts and tame,
|    creeping things, birds on the wing.

|   [148:11] All you kings and nations of earth;
|    all you princes and judges of earth:
|   [148:12] young men and maidens together,
|    old men and children together.

|   [148:13] Let them praise the name of the LORD,
|    for his name alone is exalted.
|  Over heaven and earth is his glory.
|     [148:14] He has lifted his people to honour.
|  Wherefore this chorus of praise from his saints,
|    from Israel, the people who stand in his fellowship.
|      Hallelujah.
