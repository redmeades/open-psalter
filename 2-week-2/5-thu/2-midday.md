##### Psalm 40 — Thanksgiving and Petition #####

For the leader. A psalm of David.

|   [40:1] For the LORD I waited and waited,
|    till, inclining to me,
|    he heard my cry.
|   [40:2] From the horrible pit he drew me,
|    up out of the miry clay;
|  he set my feet on a rock,
|    and my steps he made firm.
|   [40:3] He put a new song in my mouth,
|    of praise to our God.
|  Many see it, and, filled with awe,
|    put their trust in the LORD .

|   [40:4] Happy the person who has put
|    in the LORD their trust,
|  not looking to false gods
|    or turning to idols.
|   [40:5] With us you have wrought in rich measure,
|    O LORD our God,
|  your marvels and purposes for us —
|    none may compare with you —
|  were I to declare or to tell them,
|    past counting are they.

|   [40:6] In offerings bloody or bloodless
|    you have no delight,
|  but with open ears you have made me.
|  Burnt-offering and offering for sin
|    are not what you ask.
|   [40:7] Then said I, ‘Here I am,
|    as the roll of the book has enjoined.
|   [40:8] My delight, O God, is to do your will,
|    and your law is within my heart.’
|   [40:9] Well, O LORD, you know
|    that, with lips unrestrained,
|  your righteousness I told
|    in the great congregation,
|   [40:10] not hiding it in my heart.
|    I have told of your steadfast help,
|  from the great congregation I hid not
|    your love and your faithfulness.
|   [40:11] So do not restrain, LORD,
|    your pity from us.
|  Your love and your faithfulness — ever
|    may they be our shield.

|   [40:12] For evils that cannot be numbered
|    have compassed me round.
|  My transgressions have followed me up —
|    I can bear it no more.
|  They are more than the hairs of my head,
|    and my heart has forsaken me.
|   [40:13] O LORD, be pleased to deliver me,
|    haste to my help, O LORD .
|   [40:14] May those who are seeking my life
|    be ashamed and confounded together;
|  may those who delight in my hurt
|    be defeated and brought to disdishonour.
|   [40:15] May those who hurrah over me
|    be dumbfounded because of their shame.
|   [40:16] But may all who seek after you
|    rejoice and be glad in you.
|  May all those eager for your aid,
|    say, ‘Great is the LORD ’ evermore.
|   [40:17] I am weak and needy,
|    yet the LORD cares for me.
|  You are my help and deliverer;
|    don’t delay, my God.

##### Psalm 52 — The Doom of Arrogance #####

For the leader. A maskil of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul that David had gone to Abimelech’s house.

|   [52:1] Why glory in mischief, you hero?
|    God’s kindness is all the day.
|   [52:2] Engulfing ruin you plot,
|    your tongue like a razor sharpened,
|    you practiser of deceit.
|   [52:3] Evil, not good, you love,
|    and falsehood, not words of truth. (Selah)
|   [52:4] But you love all words that devour,
|    and a tongue that is given to deceit.

|   [52:5] But God, on his part, shall destroy you forever,
|    grasp you and pluck you out of your tent,
|    and root you out of the land of the living. (Selah)
|   [52:6] Smitten with awe at the sight,
|    the righteous shall laugh at you.
|   [52:7] ‘Look’ (they will say) ‘at the hero
|    who did not make God his stronghold,
|  but trusted in his great wealth
|    and in the strength of his riches.’

|   [52:8] But I am like a fresh olive-tree
|    in the house of God.
|  I trust in the kindness of God
|    for ever and evermore.
|   [52:9] I will render you thanks for ever
|    for what you have done.
|  I will tell how good you are
|    in the presence of those who love you.

##### Psalm 53 — The Folly of Denying God #####

For the leader. On mahalath. A maskil of David.

|   [53:1] Fools say in their heart,
|    ‘There is no God.’
|  Vile, hateful their life is;
|    not one does good.

|   [53:2] From heaven God looks out
|    on humans, to see
|  if any are wise,
|    and care for God.

|   [53:3] But all have turned bad,
|    the taint is on all;
|  not one does good,
|    no, not one.

|   [53:4] Have they learned their lesson,
|    those workers of evil?
|  Who ate up my people,
|    eating, devouring,
|    never calling to the LORD .

|   [53:5] Sore afraid will they be,
|    where no fear was;
|  when God scatters the bones
|    of the godless people.
|  They will be put to shame,
|    when God rejects them.

|   [53:6] If only help from Zion
|    would come for Israel!
|  When God brings his people
|    a change of fortune,
|  how glad will be Jacob,
|    and Israel how joyful!
