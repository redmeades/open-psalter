##### Psalm 35.1-16 — A Prayer for Deliverance from Malicious Foes #####

Of David.

|   [35:1] Contend, LORD, with those who contend with me,
|    do battle with those who do battle with me.
|   [35:2] Grasp shield and buckler,
|    and rise up as my help.
|   [35:3] Draw spear and battle-axe,
|    confront those who pursue me.
|    Assure me that you will help me.
|   [35:4] Dishonour and shame be on those
|    who are seeking my life!
|  Defeat and confusion on those
|    who are planning my hurt!
|   [35:5] As chaff before wind may they be,
|    with the LORD’s angel pursuing them.
|   [35:6] Slippery and dark be their way,
|    with his angel thrusting them on.
|   [35:7] For they wantonly hid their net for me,
|    and dug a pit to destroy me.

|   [35:8] Upon them may ruin come unawares;
|  may the net which they hid catch themselves,
|    and into the pit may they fall.
|   [35:9] Then I will exult in the LORD,
|    and be joyful because of his help;
|   [35:10] and all my being will say,
|    ‘Who, O LORD, is like you,
|  who save the helpless from those too strong for them,
|    the poor and the helpless from those who despoil them?’

|   [35:11] Violent witnesses rise,
|    and ask of me things that I know not.
|   [35:12] Evil for good they requite me,
|    leaving me inwardly comfortless.

|   [35:13] But when theywere sick, Iput on sackcloth,
|    and chastened myself with fasting.
|  I prayed with head bowed low,
|     [35:14] as if for my friend or my brother.
|  I went about bowed and in mourning,
|    as one who laments his mother.

|   [35:15] When I stumbled, they gleefully gathered,
|    strangers gathered around me,
|    and tore at me without ceasing,
|   [35:16] impiously mocking and mocking,
|    bearing their teeth at me.

|   [35:17] How long, LORD, will you look on?
|    Rescue me from their roaring,
|    my precious life from the lions.
|   [35:18] I will then give you thanks in the great congregation,
|    and praise you before many people.
|   [35:19] Suffer not those to rejoice over me
|    who are falsely my foes,
|  suffer not those who without cause abhor me
|    to wink with the eye.

|   [35:20] For it is not peace that they speak
|    of those who are quiet in the land;
|  but treacherous charges they plot.
|     [35:21] With wide open mouths they shout,
|  ‘Hurrah! Hurrah!
|    With our own eyes we saw it.’

|   [35:22] But you have seen, too, O LORD,
|    keep not silence, O LORD,
|    be not far from me.
|   [35:23] Bestir you, awake, for my right
|    my God, my LORD, for my cause.

|   [35:24] You are just, LORD : win for me justice,
|    let them not rejoice over me,
|   [35:25] inwardly saying, ‘Hurrah!
|    The desire of our hearts at last!
|    Now we have swallowed him up.’
|   [35:26] Shame and confusion together
|    on those who rejoice at my hurt!
|  Clothed with shame and dishonour
|    be those who are haughty to me!

|   [35:27] Let such as delight in my cause
|  ring out their gladness,
|    and say evermore,
|  ‘Great is the LORD whose delight
|    is the well-being of his servant.’
|   [35:28] Then my tongue will tell of your justice,
|    and all the day long of your praise.
