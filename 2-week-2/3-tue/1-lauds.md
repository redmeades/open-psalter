##### Psalm 29 — The Lord’s Glory in the Storm #####

A psalm of David.

|   [29:1] Ascribe to the LORD, you heavenly beings,
|    ascribe to the LORD glory and power
|   [29:2] Ascribe to the LORD the glory he manifests:
|    bow to the LORD in holy array.

|   [29:3] The LORD’s voice peals on the waters.
|    The God of glory has thundered.
|    He peals o”er the mighty waters.
|   [29:4] The LORD’s voice sounds with strength,
|    the LORD’s voice sounds with majesty.

|   [29:5] The LORD’s voice breaks the cedars,
|    he breaks the cedars of Lebanon,
|   [29:6] making Lebanon dance like a calf,
|    Sirion like a young wild ox.

|   [29:7] The LORD’s voice hews out flames of fire.
|   [29:8] The LORD’s voice rends the desert,
|    he rends the desert of Kadesh.

|   [29:9] The LORD’s voice whirls the oaks,
|    and strips the forests bare;
|    and all in his temple say ‘Glory.’

|   [29:10] The LORD was king at the flood,
|    the LORD sits throned forever.
|   [29:11] The LORD gives strength to his people,
|    he blesses his people with peace.

##### Psalm 31 — A Prayer for Deliverance from Troubles #####

For the leader. A psalm of David.

|   [31:1] In you, O LORD, I take refuge;
|    let me never be put to shame.
|  Rescue me in your faithfulness;
|     [31:2] incline to me your ear.
|  Deliver me speedily.
|    Be to me a rock of defence,
|  a fortified house, to save me.
|     [31:3] For my rock and my fortress are you;
|  lead me and guide me so your name will be honoured.
|     [31:4] Draw me out of the net they have hid for me,
|  for you yourself are my refuge.
|     [31:5] Into your hand I commend my spirit:
|    you ransom me, LORD, faithful God.
|   [31:6] I hate those devoted to worthless idols;
|    I trust in the LORD .
|   [31:7] I will rejoice and be glad in your love,
|    because you have looked on my misery,
|    and cared for me in my distress.
|   [31:8] You have not given me into the enemy’s hand,
|    you have set my feet in a spacious place.

|   [31:9] Be gracious to me, LORD, for I am distressed;
|    my eye is wasted away with sorrow.
|   [31:10] For my life is consumed with grief,
|    and my years with sighing.
|  My strength is broken with misery,
|    my bones waste away.
|   [31:11] The scorn of all my foes,
|    the butt of my neighbours am I,
|    a terror to my acquaintance.
|  At the sight of me in the street
|    people turn quickly away.
|   [31:12] I am clean forgotten like the dead,
|    am become like a ruined vessel.
|   [31:13] I hear the whispers of many —
|    terror on every side —
|  scheming together against me,
|    plotting to take my life.

|   [31:14] But my trust is in you, LORD .
|    ‘You are my God,’ I say;
|   [31:15] my times are in your hand, save me
|    from the hand of the foes who pursue me.
|   [31:16] Make your face to shine on your servant,
|    save me in your love.
|   [31:17] Put me not, O LORD, to shame,
|    for I have called upon you.
|  Let the wicked be put to shame
|    silent in Sheol.
|   [31:18] Strike the false lips dumb,
|    that speak proudly against the righteous
|    with haughtiness and contempt.

|   [31:19] How great is the goodness
|    you have treasured for those who fear you,
|  and wrought for those who take refuge in you,
|    in plain sight of all!
|   [31:20] In your sheltering wings you hide them
|    from plottings of people,
|  you keep them safe in a bower
|    from the chiding of tongues.

|   [31:21] Blest be the LORD
|     for the wonderful love he has shown me
|    in time of distress.
|   [31:22] For I had said in panic,
|    ‘I am driven clean out of your sight.’
|  But you heard my plea,
|    when I cried to you for help.

|   [31:23] Love the LORD, all you faithful;
|    the LORD protects the loyal,
|  but repays the haughty in full.
|   [31:24] Let your hearts be courageous and strong,
|    all you who wait on the LORD .

##### Psalm 147.1-11 — The Lord’s Love and Power Revealed in Nature #####

|       [147:1] Hallelujah.

|  It is good to sing praise to our God,
|    for praise is sweet and seemly.
|   [147:2] The LORD builds up Jerusalem,
|    the outcasts of Israel he gathers.
|   [147:3] He heals the broken in heart,
|    and binds up their wounds.
|   [147:4] He counts the numberless stars,
|    he gives names to them all.
|   [147:5] Great is our LORD, rich in power,
|    and measureless is his wisdom.
|   [147:6] The LORD lifts up the down-trodden,
|    the wicked he brings to the ground.

|   [147:7] Sing songs of thanks to the LORD,
|    and play on the lyre to our God.
|   [147:8] For he covers the sky with clouds,
|    he prepares rain for the earth,
|    makes grass to grow on the mountains.
|   [147:9] He gives the cattle their food
|    the young ravens when they cry.
|   [147:10] His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse,
|    his joy is not in the speed of a runner;
|   [147:11] but the LORD has his pleasure in those who fear him,
|    in those who wait for his kindness.
