##### Psalm 68 — Victory #####

For the leader. Of David. A psalm. A song.

|   [68:1] God arises, his enemies scatter:
|    they who hate him flee before him.
|   [68:2] As smoke before wind is driven,
|    as wax melts before fire,
|    so before God vanish the wicked.
|   [68:3] But the righteous rejoice in God’s presence,
|    they exult with exceeding joy.

|   [68:4] Sing to God, make music to his name,
|    his name is the LORD, praise him who rides on the clouds,
|      and exult in his presence.
|   [68:5] Father of orphans, defender of widows,
|    is God in his holy abode.
|   [68:6] God brings home the lonely,
|    he leads forth the prisoner to comfort,
|    so that none but the rebel lives cheerless.

|   [68:7] God, when you went in front of your people
|    in your march through the desert, (Selah)
|   [68:8] earth shook, the heavens poured rain
|    at the presence of God, Sinai’s God
|  at the presence of God, Israel’s God.
|   [68:9] Rain in abundance, God, you did sprinkle,
|    restoring the languishing land of your heritage.
|   [68:10] A dwelling therein your people found:
|    in your goodness, O God, you did care for the poor.

|   [68:11] The LORD spoke the glad tidings of victory,
|    a great army of women proclaim it:
|   [68:12] ‘Kings of armies they flee, they flee,
|    and the housewife divides the spoil:
|   [68:13] dove’s wings covered with silver
|    and pinions with shimmer of gold,
|     [68:14] set with stones, like snow upon Zalmon.’

|   [68:15] A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan,
|    a mountain of peaks is the mountain of Bashan.
|   [68:16] You high-peaked mountains, why look you askance
|    at the mountain which God has desired for his home
|    whereon the LORD will live forever?
|   [68:17] The chariots of God are twice ten thousand:
|    the LORD came from Sinai, his holy place.
|   [68:18] You did mount the height with trains of your captives,
|    and gifts that you had received from the people.
|    The rebels shall live with the LORD God.

|   [68:19] Blest be the LORD who sustains us daily,
|    the God who is also our saviour. (Selah)
|     [68:20] Our God is a God who is saviour.
|  The ways of escape from death
|    are known to the LORD God.
|   [68:21] Yes, God will shatter the head of his foes
|    the rough scalp of those who strut on in their sins.
|   [68:22] The LORD said: ‘I will bring you home from Bashan,
|    home from the depths of the sea,
|   [68:23] that your feet you may bathe in blood,
|    and your dogs lick their share of the foe.’

|   [68:24] In the temple appear God’s triumphal processions,
|    processions in praise of my king and my God,
|   [68:25] with singers in front, and minstrels behind,
|    and maidens with timbrels between them, singing,
|   [68:26] ‘You of the well-spring of Israel,
|    bless the LORD God in the dance.’
|   [68:27] There, in front, is Benjamin the little,
|    the princes of Judah beside them,
|    the princes of Zebulon, princes of Naphtali.

|   [68:28] God, show your strength,
|    your godlike might,
|  as you did in the past,
|     [68:29] from your temple that crowns Jerusalem.
|  Kings shall bring tribute to you.
|     [68:30] Rebuke the beast of the reed,
|  the herd of bulls, with the calves of the peoples.
|    Trample down the lovers of lies.
|    Scatter the nations whose joy is in war.
|   [68:31] May they come from Egypt with gifts of oil,
|    Ethiopia haste with full hands to God.

|   [68:32] Sing to God, O you kingdoms of earth,
|    make melody to the LORD . (Selah)
|   [68:33] Praise him who rides on the ancient heavens.
|    See! He utters his voice, his mighty voice.
|   [68:34] Ascribe strength to the God over Israel,
|    whose strength and majesty live in the skies.
|   [68:35] Awe-inspiring is God in his holy place,
|    it is Israel’s God
|    who gives strength and might to his people.
|      Blessed be God.

##### Psalm 74 — Lament on the Devastation of the Temple #####

A maskil of Asaph.

|   [74:1] Why, O God, have you spurned us forever?
|    Why smokes your wrath against the sheep of your pasture?
|   [74:2] Remember the community you purchased of old
|    to become by redemption the tribe of your heritage,
|    Zion, the mountain you made your home.
|   [74:3] Rouse yourself, visit its ruins complete.
|    In the temple the foe has made havoc of all things.

|   [74:4] Like lions your enemies roared through your house,
|    replacing our symbols by signs of their own,
|   [74:5] hacking, like woodsmen who lift
|    axes on thickets of trees,
|   [74:6] smashing with hatchets and hammers
|    all of its carved work together.
|   [74:7] They have set your temple on fire,
|    to the very ground they have outraged
|    the place where lives your name.
|   [74:8] They have said in their heart, ‘Let us utterly crush them.’
|    They have burned all the houses of God in the land.

|   [74:9] No symbol of ours do we see any more:
|    no prophet is there any more,
|    none is with us who knows how long.
|   [74:10] How long, O God, is the foe to insult?
|    Shall the enemy spurn your name forever?
|   [74:11] Why, O LORD, do you hold back your hand,
|    why keep your right hand in the folds of your robe?

|   [74:12] Yet God is our king from the ancient days,
|    in the midst of the earth working deeds of salvation.
|   [74:13] It was you who did cleave the sea by your might,
|    and shatter the heads of the ocean monsters.
|   [74:14] It was you who did crush many-headed Leviathan,
|    and give him as food to the beasts of the wilderness.
|   [74:15] It was you who did cleave the fountains and torrents;
|    it was you who did dry the perennial streams.
|   [74:16] Yours is the day; yours, too, is the night,
|    it was you who did establish the sun and the star.
|   [74:17] It was you who did fix all the borders of earth:
|    summer and winter it’s you who have made them.

|   [74:18] Yet, for all this, the foe has insulted you, LORD,
|    and a nation of fools has reviled your name.
|   [74:19] Do not give your dove to the beasts,
|    do not forget your afflicted forever.
|   [74:20] Look to the sleek ones - how full they are:
|    the dark places of earth are the dwellings of violence.
|   [74:21] O let not the downtrodden turn back ashamed:
|    let the poor and the needy sing praise to your name.

|   [74:22] Arise, God, and defend your cause:
|    remember how fools all the day insult you.
|   [74:23] Do not forget the uproar of your enemies,
|    the din of your foes that ascends evermore.
