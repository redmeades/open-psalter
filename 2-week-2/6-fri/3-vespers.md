##### Psalm 79 — A National Prayer for Deliverance #####

A psalm of Asaph.

|   [79:1] Heathen, O God, have come into your land,
|    defiling your holy temple,
|    and laying Jerusalem in ruins.
|   [79:2] They have given the bodies of your dead servants
|    to the birds of the air to devour,
|    and the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the field.
|   [79:3] Round about Jerusalem
|    they have poured out their blood like water;
|    and there was no one to bury them.
|   [79:4] On every side our neighbours
|    revile us and mock us and jeer at us.

|   [79:5] How long will you be angry, O LORD ?
|    Will your jealousy burn like fire forever?
|   [79:6] Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,
|    on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.
|   [79:7] For Jacob they devoured,
|    they have desolated his home.
|   [79:8] Do not remember against us our ancestors’ sins;
|    O meet us soon with your pity,
|    for utterly weak are we.

|   [79:9] Help us, O God our saviour,
|    for the renown of your name:
|  for your reputation deliver us
|    and cover over our sins.
|   [79:10] Why should the nations say,
|    ‘Where is their God?’
|  Let revenge for the outpoured blood of your servants
|    be shown on the heathen before our eyes.
|   [79:11] May the groans of the prisoner come before you;
|    free the children of death by your mighty arm.
|   [79:12] Pay our neighbours back sevenfold
|    for the scorn they have heaped upon you, O LORD .

|   [79:13] Then we, your people, the flock of your pasture,
|    will give thanks to you for evermore,
|    and tell your praise to all generations.

##### Psalm 104.1-23 — The Hymn of Creation #####

|   [104:1] Bless the LORD, O my soul.
|  O LORD my God, you are very great,
|    clad in awful splendour,
|     [104:2] covered with robe of light.
|  You stretch out the heavens like the cloth of a tent.
|     [104:3] He lays the beams of his chambers on water.
|  He takes dark clouds for his chariot,
|    and rides on the wings of the wind.
|   [104:4] He takes the winds for his messengers,
|    the fire and the flame for his servants.

|   [104:5] He founded the earth upon pillars,
|    to sustain it unshaken forever.
|   [104:6] With the garment of ocean he covered it,
|    waters towered over the mountains.
|   [104:7] But at your rebuke they fled,
|    scared by the roar of your thunder,
|   [104:8] mountains rose, valleys sank down
|    to the place appointed for them.
|   [104:9] They dared not pass the bounds set for them,
|    or cover the earth any more.

|   [104:10] He sent brooks into the valleys,
|    they meander between the mountains.
|   [104:11] The wild beasts all drink from them,
|    and the wild asses quench their thirst.
|   [104:12] The birds have their home by the banks,
|    and sing in the branches.
|   [104:13] From his chambers above he gives drink to the mountains,
|    and satisfies earth with the vials of heaven.

|   [104:14] He makes grass grow for the cattle,
|    and herbs for people.
|  He brings bread out of the earth;
|     [104:15] wine, to gladden hearts;
|  oil, to make faces shine;
|    bread, to strengthen hearts.
|   [104:16] The trees of the LORD drink their fill
|    the cedars he planted on Lebanon,
|   [104:17] where the little birds build their nest,
|    and the stork whose home is the cypress.
|   [104:18] The high hills are for the wild goats,
|    and the rocks are for coneys to hide in.

|   [104:19] He created the moon to mark seasons,
|    and told the sun when to set.
|   [104:20] You make it dark: night comes,
|    when all the wild beasts creep out.
|   [104:21] Young lions that roar for their prey,
|    seeking their meat from God.
|   [104:22] At sunrise they slink away,
|    and lie down in their dens.
|   [104:23] Then people go forth to their work,
|    and toil till evening.

##### Psalm 104.24-35 — The Hymn of Creation #####

|   [104:24] How many, O LORD, are your works,
|    all of them made in wisdom!
|    The earth is filled with your creatures.
|   [104:25] And there is the great broad sea,
|    where are countless things in motion,
|    living creatures, both great and small.
|   [104:26] There go the ships,
|    and the Leviathan you made to play there.

|   [104:27] They all look in hope to you,
|    to give them their food in due season.
|   [104:28] And you give with open hand;
|    they gather and eat to their heart’s desire.
|   [104:29] When you hide your face, they are terrified;
|    when you take their breath away,
|    they die and go back to their dust.
|   [104:30] But a breath from your lips creates them,
|    and renews the face of the earth.

|   [104:31] May the glory of the LORD be forever,
|    may the LORD rejoice in his works.
|   [104:32] A glance of his makes the earth tremble,
|    a touch of his makes the hills smoke.
|   [104:33] I will sing to the LORD while I live,
|    I will play to my God while I am.
|   [104:34] May my musing be sweet to him.
|    for I rejoice in the LORD.
|   [104:35] But may sinners be swept from the earth,
|    and the wicked vanish forever.
|    O my soul, bless the LORD.
|      Hallelujah.
