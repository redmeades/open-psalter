##### Psalm 122 — The Joy and the Prayer of the Pilgrims #####

A song of ascents. Of David.

|   [122:1] I was glad when they said to me,
|    ‘We will go to the house of the LORD .’
|   [122:2] Now we are standing,
|    within your gates, O Jerusalem.

|   [122:3] O Jerusalem, built close-packed,
|    like a city without breach or gap,
|   [122:4] to you do the tribes come,
|    the tribes of the LORD,
|  as the law has ordained for Israel,
|    there to give thanks to the LORD .
|   [122:5] There once stood thrones of justice
|    even thrones of the household of David.

|   [122:6] Pray that all may be well with Jerusalem,
|    and well with those who love you,
|   [122:7] well within your ramparts,
|    and well within your palaces.

|   [122:8] For the sake of my brethren and friends,
|    I will wish you now prosperity:
|   [122:9] for the sake of the house of the LORD
|     our God, I will seek your good.

##### Psalm 51 — God be Merciful to Me, the Sinner #####

For the leader. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet come to him after he had been with Bathsheba.

|   [51:1] In your kindness, O God, be gracious to me,
|    in your own great pity blot out my transgressions.
|   [51:2] Wash me clean of my guilt,
|    make me pure of my sin.

|   [51:3] For well I know my transgressions,
|    my sin is ever before me.
|   [51:4] Against you, only you, have I sinned,
|    and done that which is wrong in your sight:
|  you therefore are just when you speak,
|    and clear when you utter judgment.
|   [51:5] See! In guilt was I brought to the birth,
|    and in sin did my mother conceive me.
|   [51:6] It’s the innermost truth you desire,
|    give me therefore true wisdom of heart.

|   [51:7] Purge me clean with hyssop,
|    wash me whiter than snow.
|   [51:8] Fill me with joy and gladness,
|    let the bones you have broken rejoice.
|   [51:9] Hide your face from my sins,
|    and blot out my guilt altogether.

|   [51:10] Create me a clean heart, O God,
|    put a new steadfast spirit within me.
|   [51:11] Cast me not forth from your presence,
|    withdraw not your holy spirit.
|   [51:12] Give me back the joy of your help,
|    with a willing spirit sustain me.

|   [51:13] I will teach your ways to transgressors,
|    and sinners shall turn to you.
|   [51:14] Save me from blood, O God,
|    and my tongue shall ring out your faithfulness.
|   [51:15] Open my lips, O LORD,
|    and my mouth shall declare your praise.

|   [51:16] For in sacrifice you have no pleasure,
|    in gifts of burnt-offering no delight.
|   [51:17] The sacrifice pleasing to God
|    is a spirit that is broken;
|  a heart that is crushed, O God,
|    you will not despise.

|   [51:18] Do good in your pleasure to Zion,
|    build the walls of Jerusalem.
|   [51:19] Then will you welcome the due forms of sacrifice,
|    then on your altars shall bullocks be offered.

##### Psalm 65 — Hymn for a Thanksgiving Festival #####

For the leader. A psalm of David. A song.

|   [65:1] It is seemly to praise you, O God, in Zion,
|    and to you shall the vow be performed in Jerusalem.
|   [65:2] O you who hear prayer,
|    unto you shall all flesh come.
|   [65:3] Our sins are too mighty for us,
|    our transgressions you only can cover them.
|   [65:4] Happy the person who you choose
|    to live beside you in your courts.
|  O may we be filled with the joys
|    of your house, of your holy temple.

|   [65:5] In dread deeds you loyally answer us,
|    O God of our salvation,
|  whom all ends of the earth put their trust in,
|    and islands far away.
|   [65:6] By your strength you establish the hills,
|    you are armed with might;
|   [65:7] you still the roaring of seas,
|    and the turmoil of nations,
|   [65:8] so that those who live at earth’s bounds
|    are awed at your signs:
|  the lands of the sunrise and sunset
|    you make to ring with joy.

|   [65:9] You visit and water the earth;
|    you greatly enrich her
|  with the river of God, which is full of water.
|    You prepare the corn thereof,
|   [65:10] watering her furrows,
|    settling her ridges;
|  you make her soft with showers,
|    and bless what grows thereon.
|   [65:11] You crown the year with your goodness,
|    your chariot-tracks drip with fatness.
|   [65:12] The desert pastures are lush,
|    the hills greened with joy.
|   [65:13] The meadows are clothed with flocks,
|    the valleys are covered with corn;
|    they shout to each other and sing.

##### Psalm 149 — Song of Victory #####

|       [149:1] Hallelujah.

|  Sing to the LORD a new song,
|    sound his praise where the faithful are gathered.
|   [149:2] Let Israel rejoice in its maker,
|    sons of Zion exult in their king.
|   [149:3] Let them praise his name in the dance,
|    making music with lyre and with timbrel.
|   [149:4] For the LORD delights in his people,
|    adorning the humble with victory.

|   [149:5] Let the faithful exult and extol him
|    with glad ringing cries all night long.
|   [149:6] High praises of God in their mouth,
|    and a two-edged sword in their hand:
|   [149:7] on the heathen to execute vengeance,
|    and chastisement sore on the nations,
|   [149:8] binding their kings with chains,
|    and their nobles with fetters of iron,
|   [149:9] to execute on them the doom that is written.

|    This is the glory of all his faithful.
|      Hallelujah.
