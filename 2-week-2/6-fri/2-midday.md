##Friday Midday

##### Psalm 54 — A Prayer for Deliverance from Oppression #####

For the leader. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, “David is in hiding among us”.

|   [54:1] Save me, O God, by your name,
|    by your power secure for me justice.
|   [54:2] Listen, O God, to my prayer,
|    give ear to the words of my mouth.
|   [54:3] For proud men have risen against me,
|    and terrible men seek my life,
|    men who do not set God before them. (Selah)

|   [54:4] But see! God is my helper,
|    the LORD is sustaining my life.
|   [54:5] Let their evil fall back on my foes:
|    cut them off in your faithfulness, LORD .

|   [54:6] Then will I bring you glad sacrifice,
|    praising your gracious name;
|   [54:7] for from all distress you have saved me,
|    and feasted my eyes on my foes.

##### Psalm 56 — A Prayer of Trust in God #####

For the leader. On jonath elem rehokim. Of David. A michtam, when the Philistines seized him in Gath.

|   [56:1] O God, be gracious to me,
|    for people trample upon me,
|    all the day righting and pressing me.
|   [56:2] All the day enemies trample me;
|    many there be
|    who contend with me bitterly.
|   [56:3] In the day of my terror
|    I trust in you.
|   [56:4] In God I maintain my cause,
|    in God I fearlessly trust.
|    What can flesh do to me?

|   [56:5] They torture me all the day,
|    they ceaselessly plan to hurt me,
|   [56:6] banded together in secret,
|    watching my every step,
|    as those who hope for my death.
|   [56:7] Pay them out for their sin, O God,
|    hurl down the strong in your anger.
|   [56:8] You yourself count my wanderings.
|    Put in your bottle my tears
|    are they not in your book?
|   [56:9] Then shall my foes be turned back
|    in the day that I call.
|  Of this I am sure,
|    because God is for me.
|   [56:10] In God I maintain my cause,
|    in the LORD I maintain my cause.
|   [56:11] In God I fearlessly trust,
|    what can people do to me?

|   [56:12] Your vows are upon me, O God,
|    I will render thank-offerings to you;
|   [56:13] because you have saved me from death,
|    my feet from stumbling,
|  to the end that I walk before God
|    in the light of the living.

##### Psalm 58 — A Prayer for Vengeance on Unjust Judges #####

For the leader. Al tashheth. Of David. A michtam.

|   [58:1] Do you speak what is right, you gods?
|    With equity judge you your people?
|   [58:2] In the land you practise iniquity — all of you;
|    violence do you dispense with your hands.
|   [58:3] The wicked go astray from the womb
|    liars take the wrong path from their birth.
|   [58:4] Venom have they like the venom of snakes,
|    they are like the deaf adder that stops her ears,
|   [58:5] and refuses to listen to the voice of the charmer,
|    or binder of spells, no matter how cunning.

|   [58:6] O God, break to pieces the teeth in their mouth,
|    tear out the great teeth of the young lions, LORD .
|   [58:7] May they melt away like running water!
|    Like tender grass, cut down may they be!
|   [58:8] Like the snail that dissolves on its crawling path,
|    like the birth untimely which sees not the sunlight.
|   [58:9] Faster than a thorn-fire heats your pots,
|    he will come with his tempest and sweep them away.
|   [58:10] The sight of such vengeance will gladden the righteous;
|    their feet they will wash in the blood of the wicked.
|   [58:11] People will say, ‘Yes, the just are rewarded:
|    yes, on the earth is a God who is Judge.’
