##### Psalm 34 — The Lord is Mindful of His Own #####

Of David, when he feigned madness in the presence of Abimelech, who drove him away, and he left.

|   [34:1] I will bless the LORD at all times,
|    in my mouth will his praise be forever.
|   [34:2] In the LORD will my heart make her boast,
|    the humble will hear and be glad.
|   [34:3] O magnify the LORD with me
|    and let us extol his name together.
|   [34:4] I sought the LORD, and, in answer,
|    he saved me from all my terrors.
|   [34:5] Look to him and you will be radiant,
|    with faces unashamed.
|   [34:6] Here is one who was crushed,
|    but  cried and was heard by the LORD,
|    and brought safe out of every trouble.
|   [34:7] The LORD’s angel encamps
|    about those who fear him, and rescues them.
|   [34:8] O taste and see that the LORD is good,
|    happy those who take refuge in him.
|   [34:9] Fear the LORD, all his people,
|    for they who fear him lack nothing.
|   [34:10] Even young lions may be poor and hungry,
|    but those who seek the LORD
|     will not lack any good thing.

|   [34:11] Come, children, listen to me.
|    I will teach you the fear of the LORD .
|   [34:12] Which of you is desirous of life,
|    loves many and happy days?
|   [34:13] Then guard your tongue from evil,
|    and your lips from speaking deceit.
|   [34:14] Depart from evil, and do good;
|    seek peace, and pursue it.
|   [34:15] The eyes of the LORD are towards the righteous,
|    his ears are towards their cry for help.
|   [34:16] The LORD sets his face against those who do evil,
|    to root their memory out of the earth.
|   [34:17] When righteous cry, they are heard by the LORD,
|    and he saves them from all their distresses.
|   [34:18] The LORD is near to the broken-hearted,
|    he helps those whose spirit is crushed.
|   [34:19] Many misfortunes befall the righteous,
|    but the LORD delivers them out of them all.
|   [34:20] He guards all their bones,
|    none are broken.
|   [34:21] Misfortune will slay the ungodly;
|    those who hate the righteous are doomed.
|   [34:22] The LORD ransoms the life of his servants,
|    and none will be doomed who takes refuge in him.

##### Psalm 39 — The Pathos of Life #####

For the leader; for Jeduthun. A psalm of David.

|   [39:1] I vowed to watch my words,
|    and sin not with my tongue,
|  but to put on my mouth a muzzle,
|    while the wicked were in my presence.
|   [39:2] I was silent and dumb,
|    speechless:
|    but my pain was stirred up.
|   [39:3] My heart grew hot within me;
|    as I mused, the fire was kindled,
|    till at last the words came to my tongue.

|   [39:4] ‘Teach me, O LORD, my end,
|    and the sum of my days what it is.
|    Let me know how transient I am.
|   [39:5] See! My days you have made but a span,
|    and my life is as nothing before you.
|  It is but as a breath that everyone stands: (Selah)
|     [39:6] it is but in mere semblance we walk to and fro,
|  and all our noise is for nothing.
|    We heap up, and know not who will gather.’

|   [39:7] And now, what wait I for, LORD ?
|    My hope is in you.
|   [39:8] From all my transgressions deliver me;
|    make me not the scorn of the fool.
|   [39:9] I am dumb, never opening my mouth,
|    for this is your own doing.
|   [39:10] Remove your stroke from off me:
|    by the might of your hand I am spent.
|   [39:11] When you rebuke someone to punish their sins,
|    you consume, like a moth, what they treasures.
|    Everyone is only a breath. (Selah)

|   [39:12] Hear my prayer, O LORD ;
|    attend to my cry for help.
|    Hold not your peace at my tears.
|  For I am but a guest of yours,
|    a stranger visiting, like all my ancestors.
|   [39:13] Look away from me, let me smile again,
|    before I die and am gone.
