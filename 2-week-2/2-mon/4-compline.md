##### Psalm 4 — An Evening Prayer #####

For the leader, with stringed instruments. A psalm of David.

|   [4:1] Answer my cry,
|    God, my defender.
|  Often from straits you have brought me
|    to spacious places.
|  So now show me your favour
|    and hear my prayer.

|   [4:2] How long, you proud people,
|    will my honour be stained
|  by the slanders you love,
|    and the lies that you follow? (Selah)
|   [4:3] See! The LORD has shown me
|    his wonderful kindness:
|  the LORD hears,
|    when I call to him.

|   [4:4] Sin not in your anger:
|    but speak in your heart
|    on your bed, and be still. (Selah)
|   [4:5] Offer true sacrifice,
|    trust in the LORD .

|   [4:6] Many are longing
|    for fortune to smile.
|  Lift upon us
|    the light of your face.
|   [4:7] You have put in my heart, LORD,
|    a deeper joy
|  than was theirs who had corn
|    and wine in abundance.

|   [4:8] So in peace I will
|    lie down and sleep;
|  for you, LORD, keep me
|    safe.

##### Psalm 91 — In the Shelter of the Most High #####

|   [91:1] You whose home is the shelter of God Most High,
|    whose abode is the shadow of God Almighty,
|   [91:2] can say to the LORD, ‘My refuge, my fortress,
|    my God, in whom I trust.’

|   [91:3] For he saves you from fowler’s snare,
|    from deadly plague,
|   [91:4] he shelters you with his pinions,
|    and under his wings you can hide.

|  His truth will be a shield and buckler.

|   [91:5] You need not fear the terror of night,
|    nor the arrow that flies by day,
|   [91:6] nor the plague that stalks in darkness,
|    nor the pestilence raging at noon.

|   [91:7] A thousand may fall at your side,
|    ten thousand at your right hand:
|  but it will not draw near to you.

|   [91:8] You will only look on with your eyes,
|    and see how the wicked are punished.
|   [91:9] You have made the LORD your refuge,
|    you have made the Most High your defence.

|   [91:10] You will never be met by misfortune,
|    no plague will come near your tent,
|   [91:11] for he orders his angels to guard you,
|    wherever you go.

|   [91:12] They will carry you with their hands,
|    so you don’t hurt your foot on a stone.
|   [91:13] You will trample down lions and snakes,
|    tread on young lions and cobras.

|   [91:14] ‘Because of their love for me, I will deliver them,
|    I will protect those who trust my name.
|   [91:15] I will answer their cry and be with them in trouble,
|    bringing them forth into safety and honour.
|   [91:16] I will give them a life of many days,
|    I will show them my salvation.’

##### Psalm 134 — An Evening Invocation #####

A song of ascents.

|   [134:1] Come, praise the LORD,
|    all you the LORD’s servants,
|  who stand by night
|    in the house of the LORD .
|   [134:2] Lift your hands to the holy place,
|    praise the LORD .

|   [134:3] The LORD who made heaven and earth,
|    bless you from Zion.
