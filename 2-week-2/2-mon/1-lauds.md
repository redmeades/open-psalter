##### Psalm 24 — The True Worshipper #####

Of David. A psalm.

|   [24:1] The earth is the LORD’s and all that it holds,
|    the world and those who live in it.
|   [24:2] For he founded it on the seas,
|    and on the floods he sustains it.

|   [24:3] Who may ascend the hill of the LORD ?
|    Who may stand in his holy place?
|   [24:4] The clean of hands, the pure of heart,
|    who sets not their heart upon sinful things,
|    nor swears with intent to deceive:
|   [24:5] they win from the LORD a blessing:
|    God is their champion and saviour.
|   [24:6] Such must be those who resort to him,
|    and seek the face of the God of Jacob. (Selah)

##### The Lords’s Triumphal Entry into the Sanctuary #####

|   [24:7] Lift high your heads, you gates —
|    Higher, you ancient doors;
|    welcome the glorious king.
|   [24:8] ‘Who is the glorious king?’
|    ‘The LORD strong and heroic,
|    the LORD heroic in battle.’

|   [24:9] Lift high your heads, you gates —
|    Higher, you ancient doors;
|    welcome the glorious king.
|   [24:10] ‘Who is the glorious king?’
|    ‘The LORD, the God of hosts,
|    he is the glorious king.’ (Selah)

##### Psalm 36 — The Triumphant Power of God’s Love #####

For the leader. Of the servant of the LORD, of David.

|   [36:1] Sin whispers within the heart of the wicked,
|    who have no dread of God before their eyes.
|   [36:2] It flatters them in their eyes
|    that their sin will not be found out.

|   [36:3] First, their speech becomes wicked and false,
|    they give up acting wisely and well.
|   [36:4] Then they plot deliberate wrong,
|    take their stand on the wicked way,
|    without the least shrinking from evil.

|   [36:5] Your love, O LORD, touches the heavens,
|    your faithfulness reaches the clouds.
|   [36:6] Your justice is like the great mountains,
|    your judgments are like the broad sea.
|    LORD, you save people and animals.
|   [36:7] How precious your love, O God!
|    All may seek shelter in the shadow of your wings.
|   [36:8] They feast on the fat of your house,
|    they drink of your brook of delights.
|   [36:9] For with you is the fountain of life,
|    in the light that is yours we see light.

|   [36:10] O continue your grace to the faithful,
|    your love to the upright in heart.
|   [36:11] Let no arrogant foot tread upon me,
|    no wicked hand drive me to exile.

|   [36:12] There the workers of wrong lie prostrate,
|    thrust down to rise up no more.

##### Psalm 41 —  A Prayer for Healing and Vindication #####

For the leader; for Jeduthun. A psalm of David.

|   [41:1] Happy are those who consider the weak;
|    in the day of misfortune the LORD will deliver them.
|   [41:2] He will keep them safe, happy, and long in the land,
|    and not give them up to the rage of their foes.
|   [41:3] The LORD will sustain them on bed of languishing;
|    tending their sickness, as long as they lie.

|   [41:4] For this cause I say, ‘LORD, show me your favour;
|    heal me, because I have sinned against you.’
|   [41:5] My enemies speak of me nothing but evil,
|    ‘When will he die, and his name pass away?’
|   [41:6] When one comes to see me, their words ring hollow;
|    their heart keeps gathering mischief the while;
|    and when they go out, they give it speech.
|   [41:7] In secret they whisper together against me,
|    all those who hate me plot evil against me.
|   [41:8] ‘Some fatal disease has fastened upon him;
|    and now that he lies, he will rise up no more.’
|   [41:9] My most trusted friend, on whom I relied,
|    who ate of my bread, has turned against me.

|   [41:10] But do you, LORD, graciously raise me up,
|    that I may pay them their due reward.
|   [41:11] By this will I know you delight in me:
|    if my foes may not shout over me in triumph.
|   [41:12] For my innocence you uphold me,
|    and set me forever before your face.



|       [41:13] Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
|      from everlasting to everlasting,
|      Amen and Amen.

##### Psalm 47 — The Lord’s Universal Sovereignty #####

For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm.

|   [47:1] Clap your hands, all you peoples:
|    shout to God in ringing cries.
|   [47:2] For the LORD is most high and dread,
|    a great king over all the earth.

|   [47:3] He subdues the peoples under us,
|    the nations under our feet;
|   [47:4] he chooses our heritage for us,
|    the glory of Jacob whom he loves. (Selah)

|   [47:5] God is gone up with a shout,
|    the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.
|   [47:6] Sing praise to our God, sing praises:
|    sing praise to our king, sing praises.

|   [47:7] For king of all earth is he:
|    praise God in a skilful song.
|   [47:8] God is king over all the nations,
|    God sits on his holy throne.

|   [47:9] Princes of nations gather
|    with the people of Abraham’s God:
|  for the shields of the earth are God’s;
|    greatly exalted is he.


##### Psalm 146 — The Great Protector #####

|   [146:1] My soul, praise the LORD .
|     [146:2] I will praise the LORD, while I live;
|  I will sing to my God, while I am.

|   [146:3] Put not your trust in princes
|    mortals, in whom is no help.
|   [146:4] When their breath goes out,
|    they go back to the dust:
|  on that very day
|    their purposes perish.
|     [146:5] Happy those whose help
|    is the God of Jacob:
|  whose hope is set
|    on the LORD their God,
|   [146:6] the Creator of heaven and earth,
|    the sea, and all that is in them.

|  He remains eternally loyal.
|     [146:7] For the wronged he executes justice;
|  he gives bread to the hungry;
|    the LORD releases the prisoners.
|   [146:8] The LORD gives sight to the blind:
|    the LORD raises those who are bowed.
|  The LORD loves the righteous.
|     [146:9] The LORD preserves the stranger,
|  upholds the widow and orphan,
|    but the wicked he leads to disaster.

|   [146:10] The LORD shall reign forever,
|    your God, O Zion, to all generations.
|      Hallelujah.
