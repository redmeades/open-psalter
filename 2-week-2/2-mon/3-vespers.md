##### Psalm 60 — A Prayer after Defeat in Battle #####

For the leader. On shushan eduth. A michtam of David (for teaching), when he fought with Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab returned and defeated twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.

|   [60:1] O God, you have spurned and broken us,
|    routing us in your wrath — restore us!
|   [60:2] You have shaken the land and cleft it;
|    heal its tottering breaches.
|   [60:3] You have made your people drink hardship,
|    and given us wine of reeling.

|   [60:4] You have given those who fear you a banner,
|    a rallying-place from the bow,  (Selah)
|   [60:5] for the rescue of your beloved.
|    Save by your right hand and answer us.

|   [60:6] God did solemnly swear:
|    ‘As victor will I divide Shechem,
|    and mete out the valley of Succoth.
|   [60:7] Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh,
|    Ephraim is the defence of my head,
|    Judah my sceptre of rule,
|   [60:8] Moab the pot that I wash in,
|    Edom — I cast my shoe over it,
|    I shout o”er Philistia in triumph.’

|   [60:9] O to be brought to the fortified city!
|    O to be led into Edom!
|   [60:10] Have you not spurned us, O God?
|    You do not march forth with our armies.
|   [60:11] Grant us help from the foe,
|    for human help is worthless.
|   [60:12] With God we shall yet do bravely:
|    he himself will tread down our foes.

##### Psalm 69 — A Prayer for Deliverance and Vengeance #####

For the leader. On shoshannim. Of David.

|   [69:1] Save me, O God; for the waters
|    are threatening my life.
|   [69:2] I am sunk in depths of mire,
|    where ground there is none.
|  I am come into deep deep waters,
|    the flood overwhelms me.
|   [69:3] I am weary of crying, my throat is parched,
|    my eyes are wasted with waiting for God.

|   [69:4] More than the hairs of my head
|    are those who wantonly hate me.
|  More than my bones in number
|    are those who are falsely my foes.
|  That which I never robbed,
|    how am I then to restore?
|   [69:5] O God, you know my folly,
|    my guilt is not hidden from you.
|   [69:6] Through me let not any be shamed,
|    who wait for you, LORD God of hosts.
|  Through me let not those be confounded
|    who seek you, O God of Israel.
|   [69:7] It’s in your cause that I have borne taunts,
|    and my face has been covered with shame;
|   [69:8] I became to my kindred a foreigner,
|    to my mother’s sons a stranger.

|   [69:9] It was zeal for your house that consumed me,
|    and the insults they hurled at you fell upon me.
|   [69:10] When I chastened myself with fasting,
|    they took occasion to taunt me.
|   [69:11] When I put on a garment of sackcloth,
|    they made me the theme of a taunt-song.
|   [69:12] Those who sit in the gate make sport of me
|    in the music of drunken songs.

|   [69:13] But I pray to you, LORD,
|    for a time of favour.
|  In your great love answer me;
|    with your loyal help, save me
|   [69:14] from sinking down in the mire.
|    Lift me out of the deep deep waters,
|   [69:15] that the rushing flood may not drown me,
|    that the deep may not swallow me up,
|    nor the pit close her mouth upon me.
|   [69:16] Answer me, LORD, in your gracious kindness,
|    turn to me in your great compassion.
|   [69:17] Hide not your face from your servant,
|    for I am in trouble; O answer me speedily.
|   [69:18] Draw near to me, redeem me;
|    because of my enemies, ransom me.

|   [69:19] You know how I am insulted;
|    in your sight are all my foes.
|   [69:20] Insult has broken my heart,
|    past cure are my shame and confusion.
|  For pity I looked — there was none!
|    And for comforters, but I found none.
|   [69:21] Poison they gave me for food,
|    and to slake my thirst they gave vinegar.

|   [69:22] May their table, outspread, be a trap to them,
|    and their peace-offerings be a snare.
|   [69:23] May their eyes be darkened and blind,
|    make their loins to shake without ceasing.
|   [69:24] Pour your indignation upon them,
|    let your burning wrath overtake them.
|   [69:25] May their camp be a desolation,
|    in their tents be there none to live.
|   [69:26] For those whom you struck, they persecute,
|    and those whom you wounded, they pain yet more.
|   [69:27] Charge them with sin upon sin,
|    may they not be acquitted by you.
|   [69:28] From the book of life be they blotted,
|    may their names not be written with the righteous.

|   [69:29] Lift me, O God, by your help
|    above my pain and misery.
|   [69:30] Then will I praise God in song
|    and magnify him with thanksgiving,
|   [69:31] which shall please the LORD better than ox,
|    or than bullock with horns and hoofs.
|   [69:32] The oppressed shall rejoice at the sight.
|    You who seek after God, let your heart revive.
|   [69:33] For the LORD listens to the poor,
|    he does not despise his prisoners.

|   [69:34] Let the heavens and the earth sing his praises,
|    the seas, and all creatures that move in them.
|   [69:35] For God will bring help to Zion,
|    and build up the cities of Judah,
|    his people shall live there in possession.
|   [69:36] His servants” children shall have it for heritage,
|    and those who love him shall live therein.
