##### Psalm 46 — Our God is a Mighty Fortress #####

For the leader. Of the Korahites, on alamoth. A song.

|   [46:1] God is our refuge and strength,
|    a very present help in trouble.
|   [46:2] So we have no fear, though earth should change,
|    and the hills totter into the heart of the ocean.
|   [46:3] Let its waters roar and foam,
|    let the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.
|  On our side is the LORD of hosts,
|    our sure defence is the God of Jacob. (Selah)

|   [46:4] A river there is, whose streams make glad
|    God's city, the home the Most High has hallowed.
|   [46:5] God is within her: she cannot be shaken.
|    God helps her at the turn of the morning.
|   [46:6] Nations roared, kingdoms tottered:
|    he uttered his voice, earth melted away.
|   [46:7] On our side is the LORD of hosts,
|    our sure defence is the God of Jacob.

|   [46:8] Come and see what the LORD has done,
|    working appallingly in the earth.
|   [46:9] He stills wars to the ends of the earth-
|    breaking the bow, snapping the spear,
|    burning the chariots in the fire.
|   [46:10] ‘Refrain; and know surely that I am God,
|    high over the nations, high over the world.’
|   [46:11] On our side is the LORD of Hosts,
|    our sure defence is the God of Jacob. (Selah)

##### Psalm 116 — Song of Thanksgiving for Deliverance #####

|   [116:1] I love the LORD, for he hears
|    my voice, my pleas for mercy.
|   [116:2] For he has inclined his ear to me:
|    I will call upon him as long as I live.

|   [116:3] About me were snares of death,
|    the anguish of Sheol was upon me:
|    distress and sorrow were mine.
|   [116:4] Then I called on the name of the LORD :
|    ‘I beseech you, O LORD, deliver me.’

|   [116:5] Gracious and just is the LORD,
|    compassionate is our God.
|   [116:6] The LORD preserves the simple;
|    when I was drooping, he saved me.
|   [116:7] Be at peace, my heart, once more,
|    for the LORD has been good to you.

|   [116:8] You have rescued me from death,
|    my eyes from tears,
|    my feet from stumbling.
|   [116:9] Before the LORD I will walk
|    in the land of the living.

|   [116:10] I held fast my faith, though I said,
|    ‘Ah me! I am sore afflicted‘,
|   [116:11] though in my alarm I said,
|    ‘Everyone is a liar.’

|   [116:12] What shall I render the LORD
|     for all his bounty to me?
|   [116:13] I will lift up the cup of salvation,
|    and call on the name of the LORD .
|   [116:14] I will pay my vows to the LORD
|     in the presence of all his people.

|   [116:15] Grave in the eyes of the LORD
|     is the death of his loyal and loved ones.
|   [116:16] Ah, LORD ! I am your servant,
|    your servant, child of your handmaid.
|    You have loosened my bonds.

|   [116:17] I will offer to you a thank-offering,
|    and call on the name of the LORD .
|   [116:18] I will pay my vows to the LORD
|     in the presence of all his people,
|   [116:19] in the courts of the house of the LORD,
|    in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.
|      Hallelujah.

##### Psalm 138 — The Constancy of the Lord’s Care #####

Of David.

|   [138:1] I will thank you, O LORD, with all my heart:
|    in the sight of the gods I will sing your praise,
|   [138:2] and prostrate before your holy temple,
|    will praise your name for your constant love,
|    for you have exulted your promise above all.

|   [138:3] When I called you, you answered;
|    you gave me strength, you inspired me.
|   [138:4] All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O LORD,
|    when they shall have heard the words you have uttered;
|   [138:5] and they shall sing of the ways of the LORD,
|    and tell of the LORD’s transcendent glory.
|   [138:6] For, high though the LORD is, he looks on the lowly,
|    and strikes down the haughty from far away.

|   [138:7] Though my way be distressful, yet you preserve me:
|    you lay your hand on my angry foes,
|    and your right hand gives me victory.
|   [138:8] The LORD will accomplish all that which concerns me.
|    Your kindness, O LORD, endures forever.
|    O do not abandon the work of your hands.

##### Psalm 141 — A Prayer for Protection from Persecutors #####

A psalm of David.

|   [141:1] LORD, I call to you: hasten, to me,
|    give ear to my voice, when I call to you.
|   [141:2] Let my prayer be presented as incense before you,
|    and my uplifted hands as the evening meal-offering.

|   [141:3] Set, O LORD, a watch on my mouth,
|    put a guard on the door of my lips.
|   [141:4] Incline not my heart to an evil matter,
|    to busy myself in deeds of wickedness,
|  in company with workers of evil:
|    never may I partake of their dainties.

|   [141:5] A wound or reproof from a good person in kindness
|    is oil which my head shall never refuse.
|    In their misfortune my prayer is still with them.

|   [141:6] Abandoned they are to the hands of their judges:
|    they shall learn that my words are true.

|   [141:7] Like stones on a country road cleft and broken
|    so lie our bones scattered for Death to devour.
|   [141:8] But my eyes are turned towards you, O LORD .
|    Do not pour out my life, for in you I take refuge.
|   [141:9] Keep me safe from the trap they have laid for me,
|    from the snares of the workers of trouble.
|   [141:10] Into their own nets let wicked people fall;
|    while I pass by in safety.
