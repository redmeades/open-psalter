##### Psalm 37 — Trust in the Lord and Do Good #####

Of David.

|   [37:1] Be not kindled to wrath at the wicked,
|    nor envious of those who work wrong;
|   [37:2] for, like grass, they will speedily wither,
|    and fade like the green of young grass.

|   [37:3] Trust in the LORD, and do good;
|    remain in the land, and deal faithfully:
|   [37:4] then the LORD will be your delight,
|    he will grant you your heart’s petitions.

|   [37:5] Commit your way to the LORD ;
|    trust in him, and he will act,
|   [37:6] making clear as the light your right,
|    and your just cause clear as the noon-day.

|   [37:7] In silence and patience wait on the LORD .
|    Be not kindled to anger at those who prosper.
|    At those who execute evil devices.

|   [37:8] Desist from anger, abandon wrath:
|    be not kindled to anger it leads but to evil:
|   [37:9] for evildoers will be cut off,
|    but the land will be theirs, who wait on the LORD .

|   [37:10] Yet but a little, and the wicked vanish:
|    look at their place: they are there no more.
|   [37:11] But the humble will have the land,
|    and the rapture of peace in abundance.

|   [37:12] The wicked plots against the righteous,
|    snarls like a wild animal;
|   [37:13] the LORD laughs,
|    for he sees that his day is coming.

|   [37:14] The wicked have drawn the sword, and bent the bow,
|    to fell the poor, to slay those who walk uprightly;
|   [37:15] but their sword will pierce their own heart,
|    and their bows will be broken in pieces.

|   [37:16] Better is the righteous person’s little
|    than the wealth of many wicked.
|   [37:17] For the arms of the wicked will be broken,
|    but the LORD upholds the righteous.

|   [37:18] The LORD watches over the days of the blameless,
|    their heritage will continue forever.
|   [37:19] They will not be shamed in the evil time,
|    in the days of famine they will be satisfied.

|   [37:20] Because the wicked will perish:
|  but the foes of the LORD, like a brand in the oven,
|    will vanish, like smoke they will vanish.

|   [37:21] The wicked must borrow and cannot pay back,
|    but the righteous is lavish and gives.
|   [37:22] For those blest by the LORD inherit the land,
|    while those whom he curses will be cut off.

|   [37:23] The LORD supports the steps
|    of those with whom he is pleased.
|   [37:24] Though they fall, they will not be cast headlong,
|    for the LORD holds their hands.

|   [37:25] Never, from youth to age,
|    have I seen the righteous forsaken,
|    or their children begging bread.
|   [37:26] They are ever lavishly lending,
|    and their children are fountains of blessing.

|   [37:27] Turn away from evil and do good
|    and you will live in the land forever.
|   [37:28] For the LORD loves justice,
|    he does not forsake his friends.

|  The unrighteous will be destroyed forever,
|    and the seed of the wicked will be cut off.
|   [37:29] But the land will belong to the righteous,
|    they will live upon it forever,

|   [37:30] The mouth of the righteous murmurs wisdom,
|    and words of justice are on their tongues.
|   [37:31] The law of their God is in their heart,
|    their steps are never unsteady.

|   [37:32] The wicked watches the righteous,
|    and seeks to put them to death.
|   [37:33] But the LORD leaves them not in their hand:
|    at their trial they will not be held guilty.

|   [37:34] Wait on the LORD, and observe his way:
|    he will lift you to honour the land will be yours,
|    you will feast your eyes on the doom of the wicked.

|   [37:35] I have seen the wicked exultant,
|    lifting themselves like a cedar of Lebanon.
|   [37:36] But the moment I passed, they vanished!
|    I sought for them, but they could not be found.

|   [37:37] Preserve your honour and practise uprightness,
|    for such a person fares well in the end.
|   [37:38] But transgressors will perish together.
|    Cut off are the wicked forever.

|   [37:39] The righteous are saved by the LORD,
|    who in time of distress is their refuge:
|   [37:40] the LORD helps and rescue them,
|    from the wicked he rescues and saves them,
|    because they take refuge in him.
