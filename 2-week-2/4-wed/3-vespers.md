##### Psalm 78.1-35 — The Warnings of History #####

A maskil of Asaph.

|   [78:1] My people, give ear to my teaching:
|    bend your ears to the words of my mouth,
|   [78:2] as I open my mouth in a poem
|    on the riddling story of the past.

|   [78:3] What we have heard and known,
|    and what our ancestors have told us,
|   [78:4] we will not hide from their children.
|    We will tell to the next generation
|  the praises and might of the LORD,
|    and the wonders that he has done.

|   [78:5] He set up a testimony in Jacob,
|    a law he appointed in Israel,
|  which he commanded our ancestors
|    to make known to their children,
|   [78:6] that the next generation should know it,
|    that the children yet to be born
|  should arise and tell their children;
|     [78:7] that in God they might put their confidence,
|  and not forget God’s works;
|    but that they might keep his commandments,
|   [78:8] and not be like their ancestors,
|    a generation defiant and stubborn,
|  a generation with heart unsteady,
|    and spirit unfaithful towards God.

|   [78:9] Ephraimites, armed bowmen,
|    turned back in the day of battle.
|   [78:10] They did not keep God’s covenant,
|    they refused to walk in his law.
|   [78:11] They forgot what he had done,
|    and the wonders he had shown them.

|   [78:12] He did wonders before their ancestors
|    in the country of Zoan in Egypt.
|   [78:13] Through the sea which he split he brought them,
|    making waters stand up like a heap;
|   [78:14] he led them by day with a cloud,
|    all the night with a light of fire.

|   [78:15] From the rocks which he split in the wilderness,
|    he gave them to drink as of ocean’s abundance.
|   [78:16] He brought streams out of the rock,
|    and made water run down like rivers.

|   [78:17] Yet they still went on sinning against him,
|    they defied the Most High in the desert.
|   [78:18] They wilfully challenged God,
|    demanding the food that they longed for.
|   [78:19] ‘Is God able,‘ such was their challenge,
|    ‘to spread in the desert a table?
|   [78:20] From the rock that he struck there gushed water,
|    and torrents that overflowed;
|  but can he also give bread,
|    or provide his people with meat?’

|   [78:21] When the LORD heard this, he was furious,
|    and fire was kindled on Jacob,
|    anger flared up against Israel.

|   [78:22] For they put no trust in God,
|    no confidence in his help.
|   [78:23] So he summoned the clouds above;
|    and, opening the doors of heaven,
|   [78:24] he rained manna upon them for food,
|    and grain of heaven he gave them.
|   [78:25] Everyone ate the bread of angels;
|    he sent them food to the full.

|   [78:26] He launched the east wind in the heavens,
|    and guided the south by his power.
|   [78:27] He rained meat upon them like dust,
|    winged bird like the sand of the sea.
|   [78:28] In the midst of their camp he dropped it,
|    all around their tents.

|   [78:29] They ate and were more than filled;
|    he had brought them the thing they desired.
|   [78:30] But the thing they desired became loathsome:
|    while their food was still in their mouths,
|   [78:31] the wrath of God rose against them.
|    He slew the stoutest among them,
|    and laid low the young men of Israel.

|   [78:32] Yet for all this they sinned yet more,
|    and refused to believe in his wonders.
|   [78:33] So he ended their days in a breath,
|    and their years in sudden dismay.
|   [78:34] When he slew them, then they sought after him,
|    they turned and sought God with diligence.

|   [78:35] They remembered that God was their rock,
|    and the Most High God their redeemer.

##### Psalm 83 — A Prayer for the Destruction of the Enemies of Judah #####

A song, a psalm of Asaph.

|   [83:1] Do not keep silent, O God:
|    hold not your peace, be not still, God.
|   [83:2] For see! Your enemies roar,
|    those who hate you lift up their heads,
|   [83:3] laying crafty plans for your people,
|    and plotting against those you treasure.
|   [83:4] ‘Come, let us wipe them out as a nation,
|    so Israel’s name will be mentioned no more.’

|   [83:5] For, conspiring with one accord,
|    they have made a league against you
|   [83:6] Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites,
|    Moab, and the Hagrites.
|   [83:7] Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
|    Philistia, with the people of Tyre;
|   [83:8] Syria, too, is confederate,
|    they have strengthened the children of Lot. (Selah)

|   [83:9] Deal with them as you dealt with Midian,
|    with Sisera, with Jabin, at the torrent of Kishon,
|   [83:10] who at Endor were destroyed,
|    and became dung for the field.
|   [83:11] Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
|    all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
|   [83:12] who said, ‘Let us take for ourselves
|    the meadows of God.’

|   [83:13] Whirl them, my God, like dust,
|    like stubble before the wind.
|   [83:14] As the fire that kindles the forest,
|    as flame that sets mountains ablaze,
|   [83:15] so with your tempest pursue them,
|    terrify them with your hurricane.
|   [83:16] Make them blush with shame;
|    until they seek your name, O LORD .
|   [83:17] Everlasting shame and confusion,
|    disgrace and destruction be theirs.
|   [83:18] Teach those who you alone
|    are most high over all the earth.
