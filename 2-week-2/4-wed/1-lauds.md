##Wednesday Lauds

##### Psalm 67 — A Harvest Thanksgiving #####

For the leader. On stringed instruments. A psalm. A song.

|   [67:1] Bless us, O God, with your favour,
|    let the light of your face fall upon us; (Selah)
|   [67:2] that the world may know your way,
|    and all nations your power to save.

|   [67:3] Let the peoples praise you, O God;
|    let the peoples all of them praise you.
|   [67:4] Let the nations ring out their joy;
|    for you govern the peoples with equity,
|    and guide the nations on earth. (Selah)
|   [67:5] Let the peoples praise you, O God,
|    let the peoples, all of them, praise you.

|   [67:6] The earth has yielded her increase
|    by the blessing of God, our God.
|   [67:7] May this blessing of ours win people to him
|    to all the ends of the earth.

##### Psalm 42 — Yearning for God #####

For the leader. A maskil of the Korahites.

|   [42:1] Like the hart which longs
|    for brooks of water,
|  I long
|    for you, God.

|   [42:2] I thirst for God,
|    for my living God.
|  When shall I enter in,
|    and see the face of God?
|   [42:3] My tears have been my food
|    by day and by night;
|  for they say to me all the day long,
|    ‘Where is your God?’

|   [42:4] My heart floods with sorrow,
|    as I call to mind:
|  how I used to pass on with the throng,
|    at their head, to the house of God,
|  with glad shouts and giving of thanks,
|    in the throng who kept festival.

|   [42:5] Why am I downcast?
|    Why this moaning within me?
|  Hope in God;
|    for yet will I praise him,
|    my help, my God.

|   [42:6] I am sunk in my misery;
|    I will therefore call you to mind
|  from the land of Jordan and Hermon,
|    the mountain Mizar.
|   [42:7] Flood is calling to flood
|    at the noise of your cataracts;
|  all your waves and your breakers
|    have passed over me.

|   [42:8] In the day I cry to the LORD
|     to summon his kindness;
|  and the song that I sing in the night
|    is a prayer to the living God.
|   [42:9] I say to God my rock,
|    ‘Why have you forgotten me?
|  Why must I walk so sadly,
|    so hard pressed by the foe?’
|   [42:10] It pierces me to the heart
|    to hear the enemy’s taunts,
|  as all the day long they say to me,
|    ‘Where is your God?’

|   [42:11] Why am I downcast?
|    Why this moaning within me?
|  Hope in God;
|    for yet will I praise him,
|    my help, my God.

 [Psalms 43] 

 ##### Psalm 43 — Plea for Help #####

 |   [43:1] Right me, defend my cause
 |    against a pitiless people.
 |  From the crafty and crooked,
 |    O God, deliver me.
 |   [43:2] For you are God my protector:
 |    why have you cast me off?
 |  Why must I walk so sadly,
 |    so hard pressed by the foe?
 |   [43:3] Send forth your light and your truth,
 |    let them be my guides:
 |  to your holy hill let them bring me,
 |    to the place where you live.
 |   [43:4] Then will I go to God’s altar,
 |    to God my rejoicing;
 |  and with joy on the lyre I will praise you,
 |    O God, my God.

 |   [43:5] Why am I downcast?
 |    Why this moaning within me?
 |  Hope in God;
 |    for yet will I praise him,
 |    my help, my God.

 ##### Psalm 57 — A Prayer for Protection from Persecution #####

 For the leader. Al tashheth. A michtam of David, when he fled from Saul into a cave.

 |   [57:1] Be gracious, O God, be gracious to me,
 |    for in you I take shelter.
 |  In your sheltering wings I take refuge,
 |    till ruin be over past.
 |   [57:2] I cry to the Most High God,
 |    to the God who accomplishes for me.
 |   [57:3] He will send me his succour from heaven,
 |    he will thrust away those who would trample me. (Selah)
 |   [57:4] In the midst of lions I lie,
 |    who devour human prey.
 |  Their teeth are spears and arrows,
 |    and their tongue is a sharpened sword.
 |   [57:5] Be exalted, God, o”er the heavens,
 |    and your glory o”er all the earth.

 |   [57:6] They set a net for my feet,
 |    but in it was their own foot caught.
 |  Before me they dug a pit,
 |    but they fell into it themselves. (Selah)

 |   [57:7] My heart is steadfast, O God,
 |    my heart is steadfast.
 |  I would sing, I would make music;
 |     [57:8] awake, my soul.
 |  Awake, harp and lyre;
 |    I would wake the dawn.
 |   [57:9] I would praise you among the peoples, O LORD,
 |    and make music among the nations to you;
 |   [57:10] for great to heaven is your love,
 |    and your faithfulness to the clouds.
 |   [57:11] Be exalted, God, o”er the heavens,
 |    and your glory o”er all the earth.

##### Psalm 147.12-20 — The Lord’s Love and Power Revealed in Nature #####

|   [147:12] Praise the LORD, then, O Jerusalem:
|    sing praise to your God, O Zion.
|   [147:13] For he strengthens the bars of your gates,
|    and blesses your children within you.
|   [147:14] He brings peace to your borders,
|    and choicest of wheat in abundance.
|   [147:15] He sends his command to the earth:
|    his word runs very swiftly.
|   [147:16] Snow he gives like wool,
|    frost he scatters like ashes.
|   [147:17] He casts forth his ice like morsels:
|    who can stand before his cold?
|   [147:18] He sends forth his word, and melts them:
|    his wind blows the waters flow.

|   [147:19] He declares his word to Jacob,
|    his statutes and judgments to Israel.
|   [147:20] No other nation did he do this for,
|    they know nothing of his judgments.
|      Hallelujah.
